I think i\\'ve memorized The Obstacle Is The Way almost entirely, everytime i ready it feels familiar and i know the next phrase likes pieces falling perfectly in place in a cascade (especially if i reread a couple of times after a layoff) but the problem is: i can\\'t remember by my own! Everything comes fluidly reading out loud but if i had to recite from heart i would suddenly forget big chunks of it.If you ever did singing classes - or simply sang with the music - you know how much more easier it to find the tone when the song is on or there\\'s a coach is doing with you, but once he/she asks you to go by yourself... *gulp* you\\'re in a bit of a pickle. That\\'s because doing by yourself is much more harder and weaknesses of yours are exposed, you naturally start to notice things about yourself, about your pattern of thinking and your technique that you don\\'t notice normally, there\\'s much more presence and self awareness.After using Active Recall in past few months i realized how much more different it is from passively reading, there\\'s a more intense \"imagery\", you have to use much more brain power to remember and at times feels like you are physically exerting yourself to pull something. But your ideas feels more powerful, permanent, and this different feeling gives you confidence that you don\\'t get with the old way (it\\'s kinda common sense to be honest, like the principle of specificity in Power/Olyliftiing).

This is really important when communicating learning.  Practical tip, count one thousand, two thousand at the end of each section to give the listener time to quickly digest.

If you tried to use your System 2 for everything your brain would be completely fried! (Thanks Core a).Now i had an epiphany that IS OKAY to forget what i have to do, what it is important and why, and losing an absurd amount of time getting distracted. It\\'s just how our brain normally works so we external cues to keep us in trap, even someone who lives on a harsh envinronment, it\\'s not like they have more discipline, it\\'s just that pretators, lack of water, cold climate forces them to act in a certain way (like military man on Power of Habits who changed Food tends out of place and people couldn\\'t mob anymore or Arrakis and Salusa Secundus - \"author Frank Herbert was very interest in how envinronment affects people and how people affects their envinronment\" - just like we lose muscle if we stop training cause they are just useless energy expenditure now, a Fremen wouldn\\'t need to keep high alertness for danger and be utterly stricty with water use if they started living in Caladan. They would INEVITABLY lose discipline cause there\\'s no Sandworns there and there\\'s water fucking EVERYWHERE! So is okay accept forgetfulness and procrastination impulses and to rely on external tools to keep us in track of what we do and why, and to remind us what is important to us. It\\'s not a sign of weakness. And for someone as maniac with control as me i think i need to start to think of it like eating food, something external that i can\\'t just stop using cause i want to self sufficient.

       "      <td>these things you're talking about productivity is definitely the domain of the spirit of god.i can tell you'll really enjoy being a christian because you enjoy thinking and that's where we fellowship with the spirit of christ. the holy spirit is the process of what we call work. that is why the bible says that except the lord builds a house, the labourers labour in vain.when jesus says seek ye first the kingdom of god, he's not talking about a physical doing but a spiritual being where we focus on the holy spirit inside of us by thinking, defining and seeing things the way god sees them. this is work and a reward in and by itself.god said to abrahm, \"i'm your shield and exceedingly great reward\"...this is because when we spend time mentally organizing processes by the holy spirit within us, it activates and exhudes faith which then causes the thing we're seeking to be given to or done for us by god.he has a network of faithful people everywhere who will cooperate and conspire with him to bless you...which then validates the other half of jesus' statement that \"all these other things will be added unto you\"... the world operates on external works which is limited by age, interest, demand/supply, money, time etc... but work done inside cannot be affected or quantified by those factors affecting those operating outside of the kingdom of god... therefore the results also seem unfair... making those without to grind harder to try to catch up...this is what your friend refers to as \"serendipity vehicle\", where the dimensions and manifestation of rewards far outweigh the work input.we should all live from out of the core of our being which is the throne of god but we're afraid of what people will say...which is why when you overcame that, you naturally began to flow and do well financially too....so yea, work is more about enjoying fellowshiping with the holy spirit but many cannot access it because of sins. sin is lack mentality and a decision to take action on our own because  of the accusation that god, or our parents, or the word of god or the holy spirit did not provide what we needed.that type of thinking costs us our lives and jesus christ came to pay for those consequences so that they can be taken out of the way from hindering us...so that we can now live our best life. all we have to do is believe in our hearts that jesus christ did indeed become a human person and died for our sins and we confess with our mouths that god raised him from rhe dead. then boom! you're saved! the holy spirit will be given to you and you now have power to \"become the son of god\"...what is this power to become? the power to become the sons of god is the power to do good to everyone whether they deserve it or not. jesus said we should do good to our enemies so that we can be the children of our father who is in heaven who makes rain fall upon the just &amp; unjust.doing good in such a way takes power! that power is the holy spirit and the way we start to exhibit that power is by analysis of intentions and decisions in terms of benefits to people...so focusing on thinking things through with respect to their benefits to people is work for which you'll be paid handsomely by god... and you'll rack up personality transformation benefits called \"the fruits of the spirit\". personally i suspect that it is these fruits that really determine your rank and payout :grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: if i may say so.jesus is very particular about these fruits. he says as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. so the fruits ypu acquire in the place of thought are translated into  reality through your words and actions because your mind dwells on these things all day... it'll be witnessed by all.again, jesus is so particular about these fruits that he tells parables about the fate of trees and branches that don't bear fruits... \"i am the vine and you are the branches...\" \"every year the owner of the vineyard came to look for fruits but found none\"... the consequences are drastic. you become unplugged! dreadful.if you've ever encountered the holy spirit and then lose connection, boy! that's the worst thing you wouldn't wish on your enemy! once when i was messing around with the new age, i lost my soul... i literally lost my soul it was the worst season ever. i would do really bad things but couldn't repent or feel remorse... and i was emboldened by my quest for wealth to keep digging deeper...until one day, in my rebellion and the quest to get knowledge about astral projection, i decided to find the book of enoch but fortunately for me, i found the original version of enoch's \"book of the watchers\" and after reading it i saw that i had screwed up terribly by getting involved in this whole new age worldview. astral projection is the worst sin and god had just prevented me getting involved. there's a veil of reality one shouldn't cross illegally whether they're angels or humans. the bible lets us know that the angels who did cross the veil to mate with human women have been chained in tartarus until judgement... so don't cross the veil, don't open your third eye or any of that wicked stuff...please know that god loves you and will provide for you if you ask according to his will. which brings me to the difference between new age and christianity.so first of all, they seem to be operating on the same set of spiritual information but while one draws you closer to god, the other leads to separation. you can guess that the new age leads to separation from god! there are many youtube testimonies of people delivered from the new age deception by our lord jesus christ. search them out. their numbers are growing daily.again, the new age talks of this type of mental work...but the origin of the messages, the intentions behind the message is death, theft and destruction of human souls and destinies. satan only comes to kill, steal &amp; destroy... but jesus christ has come so that we may have full, abundant life.the first thing that happens when you join and adopt new age philosophy is that is you worship yourself and your own abilities instead of christ. consequently your sins, insecurities and flaws are magnified and constitute a \"block\" which you then have to invest more time and effort to hack away at by doing yoga, meditation, hypnosis, reiki, nft, eft, etc.. the more you do these things, the more you have to fo them because they're taking you farther from god and opening you up to demons... at the end of the day, you have no fruits of the holy spirit because where will you get it seeing that you've separated yourself from god by becoming ypur own god. welcome to the life of adam and eve after they're cast out of the \"garden\"... and you know, that was exactly where it all started...that point where the enemy was like \"if you eat this, you become like god...\" eve's consenting to it, even though under deception was essentially consenting to sacking god from his job of blessing and care for them... that was why god then later read them their citation to say \"now your suffering begins\"...therefore a life &amp; work that doesn't spring forth from within is and can never be eternal life. operating outside of the kingdom of god which is essentially the garden of eden leads to death which is separation from god.but operating from the kingdom is eternal life because the possibilities are endless, the joy is endless, time is no longer a barrier, age has no effect on your success, basically nothing can stop you. nothing! why wealth results from following christoperating out of eden naturally leads to wealth as it's first stop because it's designed that way. jesus said to the woman at the well that if she asked, he would give her water that she'd never thirst from. elsewhere the word of god says that out of our bellies shall flow rivers of living waters...when we look at the regional planning of eden, we see that the river from within eden is supposed to flow forth into four destinations... but the very first head is pison which flows to the place of havila, the land of gold...and it is said that the gold of that place is very good...so the very first benefit of operating out of eden is that the holy spirit speaks to your financial wellbeing. this is confirmed throughout scriptures like in isaiah and again, it validates the words of jesus that \"all other things...\"so if you haven't been saved from a life of external works it's because you haven't heard of or given jesus a chance...perhaps because you never understood it all... but today you do so make good use of this opportunity to chart a different course for yourself. say this prayer:lord jesus christ, i am sorry for all the time i spent living in separation from you. i am sorry thati tried to use worldly wisdom to reach the wealth you have in store for me. father, i repent for all of these sins and the iniquity and transgressions that have resulted therefrom. i believe in my heart that you became a man two thousand years ago to become the sacrifice required to pay for my sins and to set me free from the fear of death...and having paid the price, by death on the cross, you were raised again to life by the father, on the 3rd day. therefore i confess you to be my lord and saviour and ask that you baptize me with your holy spirit and given me the life that has no end! thank you father in jesus name!something good and mindblowing is happening in your life. look out for the baptism of the holy spirit and the gift of new tongues...let me stop here...god bless you! for more conversations you can reach me at \"letstalklovenow @ gmail dot com\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>i'm not a jehovah witness, i don't do or believe in organized religion, or religious sects(galatians 5:20) ( i just serve jehovah god.).. ever since the elder body of \"jehovah witness\"( i'm not one of them, and i have never been a jehovah's witness or a member of the \"watchtower organization\" (i am a \"servant of jehovah\" or \"witness for jehovah\" :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) henderson ky congregation expelled me from the kingdom hall on january 16th 2021 for addressing a bible teachings that we all go to heaven and not just a 144,000 individuals(revelation 7:9-14; revelation 22:14) because it doesn't go along with the governing body teaches, so i realized they were just false religion(no difference than the religions they preach about) if they're not going to go along with the bible teachings, if they're going to go by what the governing body teaches rather than what the bible teaches, and brother kregg woosley and brother bruce baily  said they will escort me out of the kingdom hall if i ever come back i am no longer welcome and my invitation is revoked(is that the mark :heart_suit: of love jesus said his disciples would have, expelling your brother and friend(instead of addressing it and accepting it) for teaching bible truth:thinking_face:) i would also like  to make clear i contacted the watchtower organization in new york and talked to brothers about the message they was teaching being false and shared scriptures and told them to make sure the governing body received the message, but they still proceed to teach the lie, so i must shed light on the truth.(luke 11:33) but like i said, i was never baptized as a jehovah's witness, i got baptized outside of the organization, so i'm not baptized into any religions or member of any church, so i just actually follow jesus christ, he is my only leader(matthew 23:10) i don't do churches anymore, he's going to destroy all the religious sects, you don't want to be caught in those, no offense :pensive_face:(revelation 18:4) but i love talking to everybody about the bible anyway, i want everyone to follow jesus christ but i just don't want them to follow man, i just want people to follow the bible for what it says, quit giving to religious organizations or the church and their business(jehovah's gift of everlasting life is free through faith in jesus christ ransom sacrifice) if you want to give gifts of mercy just give to your neighbor,  do something kind for them, show love to your neighbor,(just treat them like you want to be treated) and not a church or business because matthew 24 at the beginning jesus said he was going to destroy the church(or temple) and in 70ad the church was destroyed that means we no longer have use for the church(you have use for encouragement from like-minded people and association) now we just follow jesus christ(he is our high priest) and live by the law of love, what you would have given to the church, give to your neighbors(spread out over many people be a cheerful giver), help someone out in need, even a stranger, help that poor man out, buy some one a meal, give your gifts of mercy to them, not to a mans business, just follow jesus christ(a man asked jesus a good question, \"who really is my neighbor?\" you'd be surprised to find out who jesus said was actually his neighbor, and it wasn't the obvious choices for that time period(luke 10:29-37)), try not to practice sin and teach others about them, that right there is what true freedom is,i didn't realize it until they actually expelled me, because i saw where jesus said they would (john 16:2),i just got expelled for preaching the truth and i know i didn't do anything wrong, so since i just got expelled for preaching the truth, that's when i understood the real truth and understood i wasn't meant to go into captivity as a jehovah's witnesses(or in a false religion that just uses jehovah god's name(after all they had tried to predict the end in 1975, 1925,1914(there might be more actually)and obviously they were not right(wrong or false(deuteronomy 18:20-22), just like the church of jesus christ might uses jesus name, but they are still considered false religion), they should just use their actual name ,the  \"watchtower organization\", it's an organization, it's a business, their members build what the governing body( or organization) want them to build, they slave for the governing body, they are  all just slaving for men, when they could just read the bible for themselves and get the same insight they get and slave for jesus christ :crown: and jehovah god, instead they are under and being led by a \"governing body\" not jesus christ (matthew 23:10)(try to find \"governing body\" in the bible, just like you can't find \"trinity\" in the bible (oh the hipocracy:face_with_tears_of_joy:), they're led by seven imperfect men, they slave for them and build their buildings and give them their money and those men add extra requirements that the bible does not teach, when all jesus christ told us to do was preach the good news (matthew 28:19) not build kingdom halls or churches, just preach the good news, don't even need a church for that. i recognize though like any false religion, even jw(or the watchtower organization) have some truth to their teachings, actually they have a lot of truth in their teachings (i even occasionally share some of their information, like i do other religions, that might contain bible truth, that they teach) but they also teach lies, all it takes is for one lie to make a religion false, all it took was for satan to tell one lie to deceive eve, and believing that one lie cost adam and eve their life, stop being deceived by false religion:pensive_face:1john 2:folded_hands:27and as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is

we could have lived forever without ever eating from the tree of life. jehovah god said the only reason why adam and eve died is because they ate from the tree of knowledge (what was the tree of life supposed to accomplish?)jehovah tells us:genesis 3:22jehovah god then said: ‚Äúhere the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever(the real life is actually the spiritual life, that's how we become truly alive)skip ahead to 1corinthians 15and just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we will bear also the image of the heavenly one. 50 but i tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit god‚Äôs kingdom,(now remember we're supposed to inherit god's kingdom but the bible says flesh and blood can not inherit god's kingdom so that right there tells you you're going to get a spiritual body in order to inherit god's kingdom (because we know jehovah can't lie(titus1:2) because there will be more trees of life in the recreation(mt 19:28; re 22:14)skip ahead to revelation now..revelation 7after this i saw, and look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands.  10 and they keep shouting with a loud voice, saying: ‚Äúsalvation we owe to our god, who is seated on the throne, and to the lamb.(remember when jesus transfigured himself on the mountain he was in a \"white robe\"(we know a lot of revelation is symbolic)revelation 7:14these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb(keep this scripture in mind)revelation 21:10so he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god...it had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of israel.  13 on the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.(notice where the city and the gates are, they are in heaven, actually earth is just supposed to be god's garden, the city is in heaven)revelation 22:14happy are those who wash their robes, so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates..( notice who gains access to the city (heaven) and it's gates(the entrance to heaven), those who washed their robes.(re 7:14) we know those who did that came out of the great tribulation. during one of the drama movies in the assembly(summer of 2020 friday session) she pointed out to her student(jade, like jaded) that there is no hunger, death, or pain in heaven...but we know jesus actually hungered, felt pain and could be killed on earth and he was perfect flesh and blood, so in order for the people on the earth to be able to not hunger or die we would have to obtain spiritual bodies because only in heaven do they not hunger die or feel pain... jesus was are roadmap, he was born, he was baptized, he died, but then he came back as spiritual creature and made himself known or let himself be seen to those he wanted... because also remember jesus says in the resurrection we are as angels (angels are spiritual creatures)matthew 22in reply jesus said to them: ‚Äúyou are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god;  30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by god, who said:  32 ‚Äòi am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob‚Äô? he is the god, not of the dead, but of the living( you know jesus can't lie and faithful servants of jehovah and followers of jesus christ are supposed to be resurrected if we die, just as jesus came back as the angels are(in the spiritual form) after he was put to death, all baptized christians will come back as the angels are and if they are not baptized they'll be resurrected during the 1000 years so they can be baptized so they can then get that spiritual body to be as the angels... because the bible also says in revelation that not everybody's gets resurrected during a thousand years, there are some that come to life after the thousand years where endedrevelation 20and they came to life and ruled as kings with the christ for 1,000 years. 5 (the rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.)matthew 5:8happy are the pure in heart, since they will see god.(jesus already told us servants of jehovah will actually see god and jesus can't lie just like jehovah can't tell a lie and the bible is god's word):red_heart::red_heart:galatians 5 on the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,  23 mildness, self-control. against such things there is no law:red_heart::red_heart::light_bulb:james 4:12:light_bulb:12there is only one who is lawgiver and judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy. but you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?isaiah 2:22:folded_hands:for your own sakes, quit trusting in mere man,who is only the breath in his nostrils. why should he be taken into account?:folded_hands:proverbs 17:17:thinking_face:a true friend shows love at all times..:thinking_face:</td>\n",

       "      <td>:shamrock: i just found you recently as i am endeavoring to utilize notion as my 'life' dashboard. trying to juggle sooo much and tired of forgetting all the pieces. lol. anyway, yes, so important to be compassionate with ourselves in a balanced way of pushing past the uncomfortable to 'get where we want to go' (starting rituals and 'done is better than perfect' attitude to gtd help too)... and letting go of some 'good' things to make sure we have enough room for the 'better' stuff. boundaries is a good newish word for me. around my time and my energy. i've had to 'parent' myself around sleep. (i love knowing there is a term for the trap i fall into... 'revenge....??' lol.) though sometime's i get stuck in a rabbit hole of research about good stuff and am up way too late. i realize i am not as productive as i think i am when i'm doing 'work' that gets in the way of a restorative nights sleep. bottom line, we are all works in progress and we need to give ourselves a break and not beat us up when we fall short. just keep going. generally, our body is telling us when we need to realign our priorities by responding in the way you describe. our central nervous system needs some attention. we go go go... and realize we are out of balance and without taking time for 'self care' routines. we will be forced by our natural physical response (pain, illness, fatigue, brain fog... etc.) to slow the heck down. i've spent a couple years dealing with cptsd and trauma that i didn't know i had... until i 'shut down' and had to go on a path of discovery because i didn't want to remain in the state i was in. i think all of us need to come to a place of 'awareness' at some point in life in order to truly derive a sense of completion and satisfaction and connection to ourself and the world. a couple foundational books for me: 'the artist's way' (for every human and especially if you have already decided to take on a creative endeavor like writing a book)... the body keeps the score (about how our body holds onto trauma... little or big... and how to release it). 'doing the work' by dr. nicole la pera - even if you do not have trauma in your life... what you are talking about, being in touch and connected to yourself and dealing with self and others, this book helps us all get in better touch with ourselves. recognize the discomfort we and others may feel through patterns of thought and behavior we may be unconscious about. her instagram as the 'holistic psychologist' help shift thought paradigms around and about dealing with ourselve and others. how to set better thought patterns and truly be our authentic selves and give space for others to do the same. anyway, i truly am thankful for your 'verbal processing' videos as well as all of the helpful productivity shares you provide. sharing what works for you (in real case application) is so helpful. i think as you keep doing what your 'gut' is telling you to do, even if it breaks a mold (especially if it does)... it will resonate with the folks who need it. being 'real' and authentic helps other's realize they are not so different after all... we all can connect to each other's humaness and it creates a sense of community. carry on!</td>\n",

       "      <td>summary notes:00:00 intro-the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.-the \"second brain\" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.-the \"second brain\" system has helped ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.-the \"second brain\" system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations - capture, organize, distill, express.00:41 what is a second brain and why should you have one?- a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.- building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. - every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.- the methodology for building a second brain has four parts: capture, organize, distill and express (code).04:56 c (capture)- ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.-ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes.- he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.- having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.- ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.08:32 o (organise)- ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.- this means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.- you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed.- this system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.11:07 d (distill)- ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.- this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.- different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.11:45 e (express)-the \"e\" in the second brain system stands for express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.-sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.-without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.13:09 how my second brain has helped ali-the course/book has helped ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.-the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. -the system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i personally think all emergency rooms should be built with 24 hour clinics (and 24 hour childcare centers, to take care of the children or siblings of people having emergencies). right next to them. there have been many times in my life, for either myself or my children, that we needed urgent medical care, it couldn‚Äôt wait until morning or until monday, but we didn‚Äôt need an emergency either, we just needed to see a doctor right away. so we greeted our teeth, and clutched our wallet and headed to the er (where we really didn‚Äôt need or want to be, and definitely didn‚Äôt want to pay for $150 urgent care vs $4,000 er for the same treatment). had there been an urgent care clinic open in the middle of the night i would have gone there.       so here‚Äôs how it would work. patients come in. they see a receptionist (who has enough medical training to tell the difference between those needing urgent care vs emergency care and then directs them where they need to go.  this should take a fair amount of strain off of emergency rooms, especially during flu season. and if someone happens to go in for something that seems minor but turns out to be major, well they are still right next to the emergency room, and they can either quickly wheel them over, or call the er for help.  honestly it would also be a good idea to have a separate area just for infections patients too, so that way people having strokes and heart attacks also won‚Äôt get covid or influenza while they are in the waiting room or er. there should also be a nurse or emt assigned just to the waiting room. they can even start administering care if needed. there have been several times i have gone to the er because i couldn‚Äôt breath (asthma), or anxiety attacks, sometimes both, and i honestly thought i was going to die right there in the waiting room. it is really, really scary waiting 45 -60 minutes to see a doctor when you cannot breath or are having an active anxiety attack. unfortunately when you are young, people never seem to think your emergency are as urgent as older people‚Äôs. also get some bed in the waiting room! when i had appendicitis when i was a teenage i laid on the tile floor in the er waiting room for over 30 minutes, balling my guts out trying not to dye. i couldn‚Äôt even sit stand or walk. it‚Äôs one thing if the medical emergency is traumatizing, but the emergency room, (or waiting room),  itself should never be the cause of trauma, but for me poor care and treatment at ers has been much more traumatic then the actual emergencies. also all maternity/prenatal emergencies should be sent to labor/delivery units (even if the mother is not in labor), because these emergencies need gynecologists and specialized equipment that ers don‚Äôt have.</td>\n",

       "1301   these things you're talking about productivity is definitely the domain of the spirit of god.i can tell you'll really enjoy being a christian because you enjoy thinking and that's where we fellowship with the spirit of christ. the holy spirit is the process of what we call work. that is why the bible says that except the lord builds a house, the labourers labour in vain.when jesus says seek ye first the kingdom of god, he's not talking about a physical doing but a spiritual being where we focus on the holy spirit inside of us by thinking, defining and seeing things the way god sees them. this is work and a reward in and by itself.god said to abrahm, \"i'm your shield and exceedingly great reward\"...this is because when we spend time mentally organizing processes by the holy spirit within us, it activates and exhudes faith which then causes the thing we're seeking to be given to or done for us by god.he has a network of faithful people everywhere who will cooperate and conspire with him to bless you...which then validates the other half of jesus' statement that \"all these other things will be added unto you\"... the world operates on external works which is limited by age, interest, demand/supply, money, time etc... but work done inside cannot be affected or quantified by those factors affecting those operating outside of the kingdom of god... therefore the results also seem unfair... making those without to grind harder to try to catch up...this is what your friend refers to as \"serendipity vehicle\", where the dimensions and manifestation of rewards far outweigh the work input.we should all live from out of the core of our being which is the throne of god but we're afraid of what people will say...which is why when you overcame that, you naturally began to flow and do well financially too....so yea, work is more about enjoying fellowshiping with the holy spirit but many cannot access it because of sins. sin is lack mentality and a decision to take action on our own because  of the accusation that god, or our parents, or the word of god or the holy spirit did not provide what we needed.that type of thinking costs us our lives and jesus christ came to pay for those consequences so that they can be taken out of the way from hindering us...so that we can now live our best life. all we have to do is believe in our hearts that jesus christ did indeed become a human person and died for our sins and we confess with our mouths that god raised him from rhe dead. then boom! you're saved! the holy spirit will be given to you and you now have power to \"become the son of god\"...what is this power to become? the power to become the sons of god is the power to do good to everyone whether they deserve it or not. jesus said we should do good to our enemies so that we can be the children of our father who is in heaven who makes rain fall upon the just & unjust.doing good in such a way takes power! that power is the holy spirit and the way we start to exhibit that power is by analysis of intentions and decisions in terms of benefits to people...so focusing on thinking things through with respect to their benefits to people is work for which you'll be paid handsomely by god... and you'll rack up personality transformation benefits called \"the fruits of the spirit\". personally i suspect that it is these fruits that really determine your rank and payout :grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: if i may say so.jesus is very particular about these fruits. he says as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. so the fruits ypu acquire in the place of thought are translated into  reality through your words and actions because your mind dwells on these things all day... it'll be witnessed by all.again, jesus is so particular about these fruits that he tells parables about the fate of trees and branches that don't bear fruits... \"i am the vine and you are the branches...\" \"every year the owner of the vineyard came to look for fruits but found none\"... the consequences are drastic. you become unplugged! dreadful.if you've ever encountered the holy spirit and then lose connection, boy! that's the worst thing you wouldn't wish on your enemy! once when i was messing around with the new age, i lost my soul... i literally lost my soul it was the worst season ever. i would do really bad things but couldn't repent or feel remorse... and i was emboldened by my quest for wealth to keep digging deeper...until one day, in my rebellion and the quest to get knowledge about astral projection, i decided to find the book of enoch but fortunately for me, i found the original version of enoch's \"book of the watchers\" and after reading it i saw that i had screwed up terribly by getting involved in this whole new age worldview. astral projection is the worst sin and god had just prevented me getting involved. there's a veil of reality one shouldn't cross illegally whether they're angels or humans. the bible lets us know that the angels who did cross the veil to mate with human women have been chained in tartarus until judgement... so don't cross the veil, don't open your third eye or any of that wicked stuff...please know that god loves you and will provide for you if you ask according to his will. which brings me to the difference between new age and christianity.so first of all, they seem to be operating on the same set of spiritual information but while one draws you closer to god, the other leads to separation. you can guess that the new age leads to separation from god! there are many youtube testimonies of people delivered from the new age deception by our lord jesus christ. search them out. their numbers are growing daily.again, the new age talks of this type of mental work...but the origin of the messages, the intentions behind the message is death, theft and destruction of human souls and destinies. satan only comes to kill, steal & destroy... but jesus christ has come so that we may have full, abundant life.the first thing that happens when you join and adopt new age philosophy is that is you worship yourself and your own abilities instead of christ. consequently your sins, insecurities and flaws are magnified and constitute a \"block\" which you then have to invest more time and effort to hack away at by doing yoga, meditation, hypnosis, reiki, nft, eft, etc.. the more you do these things, the more you have to fo them because they're taking you farther from god and opening you up to demons... at the end of the day, you have no fruits of the holy spirit because where will you get it seeing that you've separated yourself from god by becoming ypur own god. welcome to the life of adam and eve after they're cast out of the \"garden\"... and you know, that was exactly where it all started...that point where the enemy was like \"if you eat this, you become like god...\" eve's consenting to it, even though under deception was essentially consenting to sacking god from his job of blessing and care for them... that was why god then later read them their citation to say \"now your suffering begins\"...therefore a life & work that doesn't spring forth from within is and can never be eternal life. operating outside of the kingdom of god which is essentially the garden of eden leads to death which is separation from god.but operating from the kingdom is eternal life because the possibilities are endless, the joy is endless, time is no longer a barrier, age has no effect on your success, basically nothing can stop you. nothing! why wealth results from following christoperating out of eden naturally leads to wealth as it's first stop because it's designed that way. jesus said to the woman at the well that if she asked, he would give her water that she'd never thirst from. elsewhere the word of god says that out of our bellies shall flow rivers of living waters...when we look at the regional planning of eden, we see that the river from within eden is supposed to flow forth into four destinations... but the very first head is pison which flows to the place of havila, the land of gold...and it is said that the gold of that place is very good...so the very first benefit of operating out of eden is that the holy spirit speaks to your financial wellbeing. this is confirmed throughout scriptures like in isaiah and again, it validates the words of jesus that \"all other things...\"so if you haven't been saved from a life of external works it's because you haven't heard of or given jesus a chance...perhaps because you never understood it all... but today you do so make good use of this opportunity to chart a different course for yourself. say this prayer:lord jesus christ, i am sorry for all the time i spent living in separation from you. i am sorry thati tried to use worldly wisdom to reach the wealth you have in store for me. father, i repent for all of these sins and the iniquity and transgressions that have resulted therefrom. i believe in my heart that you became a man two thousand years ago to become the sacrifice required to pay for my sins and to set me free from the fear of death...and having paid the price, by death on the cross, you were raised again to life by the father, on the 3rd day. therefore i confess you to be my lord and saviour and ask that you baptize me with your holy spirit and given me the life that has no end! thank you father in jesus name!something good and mindblowing is happening in your life. look out for the baptism of the holy spirit and the gift of new tongues...let me stop here...god bless you! for more conversations you can reach me at \"letstalklovenow @ gmail dot com\".   \n",

god.).. ever since the elder body of \"jehovah witness\"( i'm not one of them, and i have never been a jehovah's witness or a member of the \"watchtower organization\" (i am a \"servant of jehovah\" or \"witness for jehovah\" :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) henderson ky congregation expelled me from the kingdom hall on january 16th 2021 for addressing a bible teachings that we all go to heaven and not just a 144,000 individuals(revelation 7:9-14; revelation 22:14) because it doesn't go along with the governing body teaches, so i realized they were just false religion(no difference than the religions they preach about) if they're not going to go along with the bible teachings, if they're going to go by what the governing body teaches rather than what the bible teaches, and brother kregg woosley and brother bruce baily  said they will escort me out of the kingdom hall if i ever come back i am no longer welcome and my invitation is revoked(is that the mark :heart_suit: of love jesus said his disciples would have, expelling your brother and friend(instead of addressing it and accepting it) for teaching bible truth:thinking_face:) i would also like  to make clear i contacted the watchtower organization in new york and talked to brothers about the message they was teaching being false and shared scriptures and told them to make sure the governing body received the message, but they still proceed to teach the lie, so i must shed light on the truth.(luke 11:33) but like i said, i was never baptized as a jehovah's witness, i got baptized outside of the organization, so i'm not baptized into any religions or member of any church, so i just actually follow jesus christ, he is my only leader(matthew 23:10) i don't do churches anymore, he's going to destroy all the religious sects, you don't want to be caught in those, no offense :pensive_face:(revelation 18:4) but i love talking to everybody about the bible anyway, i want everyone to follow jesus christ but i just don't want them to follow man, i just want people to follow the bible for what it says, quit giving to religious organizations or the church and their business(jehovah's gift of everlasting life is free through faith in jesus christ ransom sacrifice) if you want to give gifts of mercy just give to your neighbor,  do something kind for them, show love to your neighbor,(just treat them like you want to be treated) and not a church or business because matthew 24 at the beginning jesus said he was going to destroy the church(or temple) and in 70ad the church was destroyed that means we no longer have use for the church(you have use for encouragement from like-minded people and association) now we just follow jesus christ(he is our high priest) and live by the law of love, what you would have given to the church, give to your neighbors(spread out over many people be a cheerful giver), help someone out in need, even a stranger, help that poor man out, buy some one a meal, give your gifts of mercy to them, not to a mans business, just follow jesus christ(a man asked jesus a good question, \"who really is my neighbor?\" you'd be surprised to find out who jesus said was actually his neighbor, and it wasn't the obvious choices for that time period(luke 10:29-37)), try not to practice sin and teach others about them, that right there is what true freedom is,i didn't realize it until they actually expelled me, because i saw where jesus said they would (john 16:2),i just got expelled for preaching the truth and i know i didn't do anything wrong, so since i just got expelled for preaching the truth, that's when i understood the real truth and understood i wasn't meant to go into captivity as a jehovah's witnesses(or in a false religion that just uses jehovah god's name(after all they had tried to predict the end in 1975, 1925,1914(there might be more actually)and obviously they were not right(wrong or false(deuteronomy 18:20-22), just like the church of jesus christ might uses jesus name, but they are still considered false religion), they should just use their actual name ,the  \"watchtower organization\", it's an organization, it's a business, their members build what the governing body( or organization) want them to build, they slave for the governing body, they are  all just slaving for men, when they could just read the bible for themselves and get the same insight they get and slave for jesus christ :crown: and jehovah god, instead they are under and being led by a \"governing body\" not jesus christ (matthew 23:10)(try to find \"governing body\" in the bible, just like you can't find \"trinity\" in the bible (oh the hipocracy:face_with_tears_of_joy:), they're led by seven imperfect men, they slave for them and build their buildings and give them their money and those men add extra requirements that the bible does not teach, when all jesus christ told us to do was preach the good news (matthew 28:19) not build kingdom halls or churches, just preach the good news, don't even need a church for that. i recognize though like any false religion, even jw(or the watchtower organization) have some truth to their teachings, actually they have a lot of truth in their teachings (i even occasionally share some of their information, like i do other religions, that might contain bible truth, that they teach) but they also teach lies, all it takes is for one lie to make a religion false, all it took was for satan to tell one lie to deceive eve, and believing that one lie cost adam and eve their life, stop being deceived by false religion:pensive_face:1john 2:folded_hands:27and as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie. just as it has taught you, remain in union with him.:folded_hands:matthew 23:13:prohibited:‚Äúwoe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men; for you yourselves do not go in, neither do you permit those on their way in to go in.:prohibited:acts 13:eyes:when the jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things paul was saying.46then paul and bar πna¬∑bas boldly said to them: ‚Äúit was necessary for the word of god to be spoken first to you. since you are rejecting it and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations.:eyes:proverbs 17:17:thinking_face:a true friend shows love at all times..:thinking_face:john 16:speaking_head:i have said these things to you so that you may not be stumbled.  2 men will expel you from the synagogue. in fact, the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has offered a sacred service to god. 3 but they will do these things because they have not come to know either the father or me.  4 nevertheless, i have told you these things

we could have lived forever without ever eating from the tree of life. jehovah god said the only reason why adam and eve died is because they ate from the tree of knowledge (what was the tree of life supposed to accomplish?)jehovah tells us:genesis 3:22jehovah god then said: ‚Äúhere the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever(the real life is actually the spiritual life, that's how we become truly alive)skip ahead to 1corinthians 15and just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we will bear also the image of the heavenly one. 50 but i tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit god‚Äôs kingdom,(now remember we're supposed to inherit god's kingdom but the bible says flesh and blood can not inherit god's kingdom so that right there tells you you're going to get a spiritual body in order to inherit god's kingdom (because we know jehovah can't lie(titus1:2) because there will be more trees of life in the recreation(mt 19:28; re 22:14)skip ahead to revelation now..revelation 7after this i saw, and look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands.  10 and they keep shouting with a loud voice, saying: ‚Äúsalvation we owe to our god, who is seated on the throne, and to the lamb.(remember when jesus transfigured himself on the mountain he was in a \"white robe\"(we know a lot of revelation is symbolic)revelation 7:14these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb(keep this scripture in mind)revelation 21:10so he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god...it had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of israel.  13 on the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.(notice where the city and the gates are, they are in heaven, actually earth is just supposed to be god's garden, the city is in heaven)revelation 22:14happy are those who wash their robes, so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates..( notice who gains access to the city (heaven) and it's gates(the entrance to heaven), those who washed their robes.(re 7:14) we know those who did that came out of the great tribulation. during one of the drama movies in the assembly(summer of 2020 friday session) she pointed out to her student(jade, like jaded) that there is no hunger, death, or pain in heaven...but we know jesus actually hungered, felt pain and could be killed on earth and he was perfect flesh and blood, so in order for the people on the earth to be able to not hunger or die we would have to obtain spiritual bodies because only in heaven do they not hunger die or feel pain... jesus was are roadmap, he was born, he was baptized, he died, but then he came back as spiritual creature and made himself known or let himself be seen to those he wanted... because also remember jesus says in the resurrection we are as angels (angels are spiritual creatures)matthew 22in reply jesus said to them: ‚Äúyou are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of god;  30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by god, who said:  32 ‚Äòi am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob‚Äô? he is the god, not of the dead, but of the living( you know jesus can't lie and faithful servants of jehovah and followers of jesus christ are supposed to be resurrected if we die, just as jesus came back as the angels are(in the spiritual form) after he was put to death, all baptized christians will come back as the angels are and if they are not baptized they'll be resurrected during the 1000 years so they can be baptized so they can then get that spiritual body to be as the angels... because the bible also says in revelation that not everybody's gets resurrected during a thousand years, there are some that come to life after the thousand years where endedrevelation 20and they came to life and ruled as kings with the christ for 1,000 years. 5 (the rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.)matthew 5:8happy are the pure in heart, since they will see god.(jesus already told us servants of jehovah will actually see god and jesus can't lie just like jehovah can't tell a lie and the bible is god's word):red_heart::red_heart:galatians 5 on the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,  23 mildness, self-control. against such things there is no law:red_heart::red_heart::light_bulb:james 4:12:light_bulb:12there is only one who is lawgiver and judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy. but you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?isaiah 2:22:folded_hands:for your own sakes, quit trusting in mere man,who is only the breath in his nostrils. why should he be taken into account?:folded_hands:proverbs 17:17:thinking_face:a true friend shows love at all times..:thinking_face:   \n",

just found you recently as i am endeavoring to utilize notion as my 'life' dashboard. trying to juggle sooo much and tired of forgetting all the pieces. lol. anyway, yes, so important to be compassionate with ourselves in a balanced way of pushing past the uncomfortable to 'get where we want to go' (starting rituals and 'done is better than perfect' attitude to gtd help too)... and letting go of some 'good' things to make sure we have enough room for the 'better' stuff. boundaries is a good newish word for me. around my time and my energy. i've had to 'parent' myself around sleep. (i love knowing there is a term for the trap i fall into... 'revenge....??' lol.) though sometime's i get stuck in a rabbit hole of research about good stuff and am up way too late. i realize i am not as productive as i think i am when i'm doing 'work' that gets in the way of a restorative nights sleep. bottom line, we are all works in progress and we need to give ourselves a break and not beat us up when we fall short. just keep going. generally, our body is telling us when we need to realign our priorities by responding in the way you describe. our central nervous system needs some attention. we go go go... and realize we are out of balance and without taking time for 'self care' routines. we will be forced by our natural physical response (pain, illness, fatigue, brain fog... etc.) to slow the heck down. i've spent a couple years dealing with cptsd and trauma that i didn't know i had... until i 'shut down' and had to go on a path of discovery because i didn't want to remain in the state i was in. i think all of us need to come to a place of 'awareness' at some point in life in order to truly derive a sense of completion and satisfaction and connection to ourself and the world. a couple foundational books for me: 'the artist's way' (for every human and especially if you have already decided to take on a creative endeavor like writing a book)... the body keeps the score (about how our body holds onto trauma... little or big... and how to release it). 'doing the work' by dr. nicole la pera - even if you do not have trauma in your life... what you are talking about, being in touch and connected to yourself and dealing with self and others, this book helps us all get in better touch with ourselves. recognize the discomfort we and others may feel through patterns of thought and behavior we may be unconscious about. her instagram as the 'holistic psychologist' help shift thought paradigms around and about dealing with ourselve and others. how to set better thought patterns and truly be our authentic selves and give space for others to do the same. anyway, i truly am thankful for your 'verbal processing' videos as well as all of the helpful productivity shares you provide. sharing what works for you (in real case application) is so helpful. i think as you keep doing what your 'gut' is telling you to do, even if it breaks a mold (especially if it does)... it will resonate with the folks who need it. being 'real' and authentic helps other's realize they are not so different after all... we all can connect to each other's humaness and it creates a sense of community. carry on!   \n",

life. what are the two? there is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable. avoiding both these extremes, the tathagata has realized the middle path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to nibbana.' ‚Äî gautama buddhawhen you set firm resolutions to improve yourself, you might be tempted to push your limits well outside of what you‚Äôre capable of doing. ambitiousness is a virtue, but there‚Äôs danger involved in going from one extreme to another.if you‚Äôre currently struggling to be productive, don‚Äôt force yourself to work sixteen hours a day. if you‚Äôre struggling to control your appetite, don‚Äôt impose a week-long fast. if you can‚Äôt find it in you to choose the stairs over the elevator, don‚Äôt expect that you‚Äôll maintain a workout plan that requires you to work out every single day.find the middle path, stick to it for at least several weeks, and then, based on the results you get, decide whether you can further stretch your limits or require more time before advancing.as much as i believe in pushing your boundaries and exploring the extremes, you don‚Äôt need to put yourself through mortification to  achieve good results. subjecting yourself to extreme hardships has some merits, but over the long term it‚Äôs unsustainable, if not downright dangerous.remember that there should be moderation in all things, including moderation itself. sometimes a more extreme approach is needed for a short period of time, and sometimes it‚Äôs beneficial to set your goals lower. in whatever you do, seek to not spend too much time loafing around, but also make sure that your life hasn‚Äôt turned into the life of a self-flagellating ascetic.\"~ by meadows martin, from the book: 365 days with self-discipline: 365

point of satisfaction is jesus. longterm enduring satisfaction.i don't know if you know the story of cain and abel.cain work the ground, he was the older brother of abel, abel guarded and care for sheep, a pastor. now at this point adam and eve, ate from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they disobeted the creator who put the sun, moon, stars, water, soil animals and fruit trees all of it for his final creation, man. god had to get them out of the garden and in that he told man that he woul take the fruit of the ground ( the thing he must do to live, basically battle to live, totally contrary to the abundance of the garden) with great effort with thorns of the plants  ...in the garden they got every type of tree to eat is fruit ( yeah, vegan)... but when both man and woman ate from the tree that god told it would bring them death, they were exhiled from the presence of god , before that tho god put on them, cover them, clothed them with the skin of animals... yes, the first sacrifice of an animal was from god... they tried to cover themselves after they ate from the tree and were ashamed of each other with plants... but it wasn't enough.their to sons cain and abel offered to god. cain offered fruit from the ground and abel offered the firstborns of his flock and grease. cain offered from the work he was supposed to do, abel didn't he offered something wich wasn't eaten at the time, something wich god insinuated and protected manhood with. later in the story we see abraham (god permited us to eat meat by this point), abraham disobeyed god, god promised to abraham at his old age he would give him a son, but his wife and he tried to have one with the slave of his wife and later god asks him to sacrifice his first born son, isaac,  wich he gaved to him and his wife, by the 2 of them just as he promised .on the way up the mountain he was going to sacrifice him, isaac asked abraham were was the sacrificed, abraham responded that god woul provide the lamb. as abraham was going to sacrifice him an angel, a messanger of god, came and told him to stop, he stopped and saw a ram, wich was sacrificed instead of isaac.we know that the lamb abraham was expecting was the firstborn beloved and only son of god, sacrificed instead of his isaac, it was an act of faith that god will pay our wrongdoing because he saw  our brokenheartedness and that our only hope is he. abel also had that faith.man can work and travail but desperation in the realization we are going to die no matter how much we work and make is what gets god, in hhat desperation we accept yeshua/jesus the salvation of god, the tree of life the only way to be with god again in eden were our works are in vain in the abundance and mercy of our god. shalom ali ( i think is like that) :red_heart:   \n",

notes:00:00 intro-the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.-the \"second brain\" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.-the \"second brain\" system has helped ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.-the \"second brain\" system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations - capture, organize, distill, express.00:41 what is a second brain and why should you have one?- a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.- building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. - every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.- the methodology for building a second brain has four parts: capture, organize, distill and express (code).04:56 c (capture)- ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.-ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes.- he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.- having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.- ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.08:32 o (organise)- ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.- this means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.- you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed.- this system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.11:07 d (distill)- ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.- this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.- different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.11:45 e (express)-the \"e\" in the second brain system stands for express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.-sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.-without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.13:09 how my second brain has helped ali-the course/book has helped ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.-the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. -the system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.   \n",

                                          i disagree with the concept (if like you said, you're not \"creative\", you don't write books, songs etc., you don't require an inspiration). i started using todoist around 2013 (to be fair - i love it, and i still use it). i quickly followed it by evernote which acted mainly as my diary + \"some useful stuff\" / note taking app. of course, at that moment, connecting notes / articles was clunky, one way, hashtags, categories, no backlinks. so sooner or later, only key / critical notes were actually useful (like ie. \"packing-trip\" list ;) ). other always became more or less outdated.later, when all this backlinking hype started ;) - roam etc. , i started using obsidian. as a software engineer i liked it, because under the hood, it was a simple markdown editor. i liked it, yet ... creating notes, all these backlinks etc. was ... time consuming. it was not only about quickly writing down your thought(s), but also about thinking : \"how can i later find it\" (in this non-linear / second-brain). as a result - i prefered to quickly add a thought via todoist task - because i could do it in seconds, rather than full fledged backlinking obsidian article. i ended up with:- todoist - for daily todo tasks- stackedit - random not that important notes using quick markdown notation articles (not connected with each other) - i like that it has built-in sync from every device that literally has just a browser (this is useful - if you have tablet, desktop, laptop, mobile phone, raspebery pi etc. - this is really nice, if you want to access your articles from everywhere, every device you have without installing third party apps)- notion - as a daily diaryi don't store my thoughts, ideas as second-brain anymore because i came to the conclusion that creating such notes, maintaing them, keeping them up to date, requires waay too much effort compared to simply finding the asnwer to the topic that interests you (via google / youtube) when ... you actually need it :) the benefit of it is that:- the information you get is up to date- you don't need to maintain it- you don't need to spend time to create itif i really need something hmm personal, i try to keep it minimal, keep it flat ie. i simply create a project in todoist (like ie. computer games ideas) and write my ideas down as plain tasks.  is there anybody else who has similar experience ? :)   \n",

                                                         i personally think all emergency rooms should be built with 24 hour clinics (and 24 hour childcare centers, to take care of the children or siblings of people having emergencies). right next to them. there have been many times in my life, for either myself or my children, that we needed urgent medical care, it couldn‚Äôt wait until morning or until monday, but we didn‚Äôt need an emergency either, we just needed to see a doctor right away. so we greeted our teeth, and clutched our wallet and headed to the er (where we really didn‚Äôt need or want to be, and definitely didn‚Äôt want to pay for $150 urgent care vs $4,000 er for the same treatment). had there been an urgent care clinic open in the middle of the night i would have gone there.       so here‚Äôs how it would work. patients come in. they see a receptionist (who has enough medical training to tell the difference between those needing urgent care vs emergency care and then directs them where they need to go.  this should take a fair amount of strain off of emergency rooms, especially during flu season. and if someone happens to go in for something that seems minor but turns out to be major, well they are still right next to the emergency room, and they can either quickly wheel them over, or call the er for help.  honestly it would also be a good idea to have a separate area just for infections patients too, so that way people having strokes and heart attacks also won‚Äôt get covid or influenza while they are in the waiting room or er. there should also be a nurse or emt assigned just to the waiting room. they can even start administering care if needed. there have been several times i have gone to the er because i couldn‚Äôt breath (asthma), or anxiety attacks, sometimes both, and i honestly thought i was going to die right there in the waiting room. it is really, really scary waiting 45 -60 minutes to see a doctor when you cannot breath or are having an active anxiety attack. unfortunately when you are young, people never seem to think your emergency are as urgent as older people‚Äôs. also get some bed in the waiting room! when i had appendicitis when i was a teenage i laid on the tile floor in the er waiting room for over 30 minutes, balling my guts out trying not to dye. i couldn‚Äôt even sit stand or walk. it‚Äôs one thing if the medical emergency is traumatizing, but the emergency room, (or waiting room),  itself should never be the cause of trauma, but for me poor care and treatment at ers has been much more traumatic then the actual emergencies. also all maternity/prenatal emergencies should be sent to labor/delivery units (even if the mother is not in labor), because these emergencies need gynecologists and specialized equipment that ers don‚Äôt have.   \n",
