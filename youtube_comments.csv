I also started to wonder how much those apps might start getting in the way of actually getting things done. Yeah, you have an app that saves articles for later, but that doesn&#39;t mean it helps you get through the goal of actually reading the articles you save. To-do lists can be beneficial, but use them too rigidly; you won&#39;t want to do anything. Being productive definitely comes from an aspirational mindset, and using some (but probably not all) of the widgets can make a dredging experience more novel. That helps you get engaged with the task. Those things we don&#39;t actually want to do since we are cognitive misers and don&#39;t want to expend our mental faculties will probably benefit from a written goal with tangible evidence of completion (e.g., checking it off the list).<br><br>Simply put, you need two big things for productivity-- goals and habits. If you want to become productive, you need to set small goals that encourage your progression to a larger purpose, and you need good habits that keep you on track with those goals. The gizmos are just novel tools that can help and provide inspiration for new ideas. Learn where you can incorporate the ones you like and nix the rest. Changing your mindset and thinking more positively about the things you are doing will inevitably be more helpful, if not just to curtail stressors.', 'Really enjoyed this.

This program helped me to build self-confidence and taught me how to believe in myself. More people should find out about it. Thank you, Forwago!', 'Man alive I love your videos.', 'I would loooove to hear your process on how you plan youtube videos prior to shooting them.', 'These things you&#39;re talking about productivity is definitely the domain of the Spirit of God.<br>I can tell you&#39;ll really enjoy being a Christian because you enjoy thinking and that&#39;s where we fellowship with the Spirit of Christ. <br>The Holy Spirit is the process of what we call work. That is why the bible says that except the Lord builds a house, the labourers labour in vain.<br>When Jesus says seek ye first the kingdom of God, he&#39;s not talking about a physical doing but a spiritual being where we focus on the Holy Spirit inside of us by thinking, defining and seeing things the way God sees them. This is work and a reward in and by itself.<br>God said to Abrahm, &quot;I&#39;m your shield and exceedingly great reward&quot;...<br>This is because when we spend time mentally organizing processes by the Holy Spirit within us, it activates and exhudes faith which then causes the thing we&#39;re seeking to be given to or done for us by God.<br>He has a network of faithful people everywhere who will cooperate and conspire with him to bless you...which then validates the other half of Jesus&#39; statement that &quot;all these other things will be added unto you&quot;... <br>The world operates on external works which is limited by age, interest, demand/supply, money, time etc... but work done inside cannot be affected or quantified by those factors affecting those operating outside of the kingdom of God... therefore the results also seem unfair... making those without to grind harder to try to catch up...<br>This is what your friend refers to as &quot;serendipity vehicle&quot;, where the dimensions and manifestation of rewards far outweigh the work input.<br><br>We should all live from out of the core of our being which is the throne of God but we&#39;re afraid of what people will say...<br>Which is why when you overcame that, you naturally began to flow and do well financially too....<br><br>So yea, work is more about enjoying fellowshiping with the Holy Spirit but many cannot access it because of sins. <br>Sin is lack mentality and a decision to take action on our own because  of the accusation that God, or our parents, or the word of God or the Holy Spirit did not provide what we needed.<br>That type of thinking costs us our lives and Jesus Christ came to pay for those consequences so that they can be taken out of the way from hindering us...so that we can now live our best life. All we have to do is believe in our hearts that Jesus Christ did indeed become a human person and died for our sins and we confess with our mouths that God raised him from rhe dead. Then boom! You&#39;re saved! The Holy Spirit will be given to you and you now have power to &quot;Become the son of God&quot;...<br><br>What is this power to become? <br>The power to become the sons of God is the power to do good to everyone whether they deserve it or not. Jesus said we should do good to our enemies so that we can be the children of our father who is in heaven who makes rain fall upon the just &amp; unjust.<br>Doing good in such a way takes power! That power is the Holy Spirit and the way we start to exhibit that power is by analysis of intentions and decisions in terms of benefits to people...<br>So focusing on thinking things through with respect to their benefits to people is work for which you&#39;ll be paid handsomely by God... and you&#39;ll rack up personality transformation benefits called &quot;the fruits of the Spirit&quot;. Personally I suspect that it is these fruits that really determine your rank and payout 😅😅 if I may say so.<br><br>Jesus is very particular about these fruits. He says as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. So the fruits ypu acquire in the place of thought are translated into  reality through your words and actions because your mind dwells on these things all day... it&#39;ll be witnessed by all.<br>Again, Jesus is so particular about these fruits that he tells parables about the fate of trees and branches that don&#39;t bear fruits... &quot;i am the vine and you are the branches...&quot; &quot;every year the owner of the vineyard came to look for fruits but found none&quot;... the consequences are drastic. You become Unplugged! Dreadful.<br>If you&#39;ve ever encountered the Holy Spirit and then lose connection, boy! That&#39;s the worst thing you wouldn&#39;t wish on your enemy! Once when I was messing around with the new age, I lost my soul... I literally lost my soul it was the worst season ever. I would do really bad things but couldn&#39;t repent or feel remorse... and I was emboldened by my quest for wealth to keep digging deeper...until one day, in my rebellion and the quest to get knowledge about astral projection, I decided to find the book of Enoch but fortunately for me, I found the original version of Enoch&#39;s &quot;book of the watchers&quot; and after reading it I saw that I had screwed up terribly by getting involved in this whole new age worldview. Astral projection is the worst sin and God had just prevented me getting involved. There&#39;s a veil of reality one shouldn&#39;t cross illegally whether they&#39;re angels or humans. The bible lets us know that the angels who did cross the veil to mate with human women have been chained in tartarus until judgement... so don&#39;t cross the veil, don&#39;t open your third eye or any of that wicked stuff...please know that God loves you and will provide for you if you ask according to his will. <br><br>Which brings me to the difference between new age and christianity.<br>So first of all, they seem to be operating on the same set of spiritual information but while one draws you closer to God, the other leads to separation. You can guess that the new age leads to separation from God! There are many YouTube testimonies of people delivered from the new age deception by our Lord Jesus Christ. Search them out. Their numbers are growing daily.<br><br>Again, the new age talks of this type of mental work...but the origin of the messages, the intentions behind the message is death, theft and destruction of human souls and destinies. Satan only comes to kill, steal &amp; destroy... but Jesus Christ has come so that we may have full, abundant life.<br>The first thing that happens when you join and adopt new age philosophy is that is you worship yourself and your own abilities instead of Christ. Consequently your sins, insecurities and flaws are magnified and constitute a &quot;block&quot; which you then have to invest more time and effort to hack away at by doing yoga, meditation, hypnosis, reiki, nft, eft, etc.. The more you do these things, the more you have to fo them because they&#39;re taking you farther from God and opening you up to demons... <br>At the end of the day, you have no fruits of the Holy Spirit because where will you get it seeing that you&#39;ve separated yourself from God by becoming ypur own God. Welcome to the life of Adam and Eve after they&#39;re cast out of the &quot;garden&quot;... <br>And you know, that was exactly where it all started...that point where the enemy was like &quot;if you eat this, you become like God...&quot; Eve&#39;s consenting to it, even though under deception was essentially consenting to sacking God from his job of blessing and care for them... That was why God then later read them their citation to say &quot;now your suffering begins&quot;...<br>Therefore a life &amp; work that doesn&#39;t spring forth from within is and can never be eternal life. Operating outside of the Kingdom of God which is essentially the garden of Eden leads to death which is separation from God.<br>But operating from the Kingdom is eternal life because the possibilities are endless, the joy is endless, time is no longer a barrier, age has no effect on your success, basically nothing can stop you. Nothing! <br><br>Why wealth results from following Christ<br>Operating out of Eden naturally leads to wealth as it&#39;s first stop because it&#39;s designed that way. Jesus said to the woman at the well that if she asked, he would give her water that she&#39;d never thirst from. Elsewhere the word of God says that out of our bellies shall flow rivers of living waters...<br>When we look at the regional planning of Eden, we see that the river from within Eden is supposed to flow forth into four destinations... but the very first head is pison which flows to the place of Havila, the land of Gold...and it is said that the Gold of that place is very good...<br>So the very first benefit of operating out of Eden is that the Holy Spirit speaks to your financial wellbeing. This is confirmed throughout scriptures like in Isaiah and again, it validates the words of Jesus that &quot;all other things...&quot;<br><br>So if you haven&#39;t been saved from a life of external works it&#39;s because you haven&#39;t heard of or given Jesus a chance...perhaps because you never understood it all... but today you do so make good use of this opportunity to chart a different course for yourself. <br><br>Say this prayer:<br>Lord Jesus Christ, I am sorry for all the time I spent living in separation from you. I am sorry thatI tried to use worldly wisdom to reach the wealth you have in store for me. Father, I repent for all of these sins and the iniquity and transgressions that have resulted therefrom. I believe in my heart that you became a man two thousand years ago to become the sacrifice required to pay for my sins and to set me free from the fear of death...and having paid the price, by death on the cross, you were raised again to life by the father, on the 3rd day. Therefore I confess you to be my Lord and saviour and ask that you baptize me with your Holy Spirit and given me the life that has no end! Thank you Father in Jesus name!<br><br>Something good and mindblowing is happening in your life. Look out for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gift of new tongues...<br><br>Let me stop here...<br>God bless you! <br><br>For more conversations You can reach me at &quot;letstalklovenow @ gmail dot com&quot;.', 'I really agree with setting up your place to be in the mood to be productive.

(This a wide misconception, as vast numbers of people fill their lives with mountains of busy work, only to wind up with little to show for it.) Secondly, productivity has little to do with &#39;doing what is important&#39;. (One&#39;s list of &#39;important&#39; to-do&#39;s&#39; is potentially infinite. Therefore, attempting to work through that list can also be potentially futile.) The key to true productivity is to begin to view time as a resource you are perpetually being forced to invest. You do not have a choice, one way or the other, as to whether, or not, you will invest your time. You will, as long as you are alive. You only have a choice regarding WHERE you invest it. Therefore, a sober and honest assessment of what your potential return on investment is likely to be should start to dictate how and where you spend your time. A good empowering question to ask is, &quot;How is this action related to the fulfillment of my highest values and goals?&quot; If something doesn&#39;t support your highest values, and the actual achievement of goals that are aligned with those values, you may want to question if it is an investment worthy of your time.', '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSNfj2S6Pw&amp;t=321"">5:21</a> I&#39;m going to try this mindset right now :D Thank you Ali!', '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSNfj2S6Pw&amp;t=676"">11:16</a> so agree with this advice. I love to work with some ambience sounds, but most of the videos on Youtube have rather too loud or distracting noises. So I decided to create my own videos where I hear familiar background noises but it doesn&#39;t distract me, it puts me into a deep focus. <br>And recently somebody shared my video in a small community, I got views outside of Youtube.

Being a Dutch and, also, an EU citizen, we’re getting more and more aware of the security and privacy concerns of having your files and (meta)data stored in the cloud, like those of Google, Microsoft or Apple. I always apply the 3-2-1 rule: always have three identical copies, of which the 1st copy is, in fact, your primary, &#39;production&#39; copy (whether it is your preference to have your files stored on your device locally or just solely in the cloud), and the 2nd and 3rd are both (identical) backups, yet, separated physically and independently (i.e. literally on different locations, e.g. one on another cloud or a NAS, and the other on an offline, external drive with sufficient protection/encryption).', '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bry8a_7b9aM&amp;t=80"">1:20</a> Im confused, if someone else invites you to something why would you then send them an invite?

Here: I am not allowed to share my corporate Outlook calendar with my private calendar - it is in fact even disabled to share to anything outside the company network. And reasonably so. That forces me to have two completely different calendars. On private in say Phantastical Google Cal or whatever, and the other in my companies´ Outlook. But it is still one seamless life.

Interestingly,  we found out about this decision by accident. One of our fellow colleagues had a call to solve routine questions regarding their application and found out that his documents are no longer processed because of his Russian citizenship. ECFMG representatives later confirmed their decision and added that they will not publicly announce it on their website or social media. <br>We are not able to pay, or register for the exams USMLE Step 1 or USMLE CK. Those who have already passed these steps will not be able to go through any ECFMG certification pathways. That means that the absolute majority of Russian citizens won’t be able to take USMLE exams at all, without exemptions. This ban applies even for Russians with dual citizenship, even if it is Ukrainian or US, Russians who have political asylum in the US or any other country and even for foreign citizens, who currently reside in Russia. Ban is based solely on our citizenship and national origin, not on our personal choice, beliefs or actions taken during these tough political times. <br>Years of hard work we put into studying medicine, self improving and preparing for medical residency in the US are ruined by this quiet decision of ECFMG officials. Our work has simply been portrayed as unimportant, all due to political issues that we, in fact, have no control over. <br>Throughout the last month we have signed numerous petitions against this war, putting ourselves at risk.

Once that&#39;s done, I rush to go do whatever housework or business work I need to do, and a few hours (seems like minutes) it&#39;s time to feed everyone, again.

Revelation 22:14) because it doesn&#39;t go along with the governing body teaches, so I realized they were just false religion(no difference than the RELIGIONS they preach about) if they&#39;re not going to go along with the Bible teachings, if they&#39;re going to go by what the governing body teaches rather than what the Bible teaches, and Brother Kregg woosley and brother Bruce Baily  said they will escort me out of the kingdom Hall if I ever come back I am no longer welcome and my invitation is revoked(is that the mark ♥️ of love Jesus said his disciples would have, expelling your brother and friend(instead of addressing it and accepting it) for teaching Bible Truth🤔) I would also like  to make clear I CONTACTED the WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION in New York and talked to brothers about the message they was teaching being false and shared SCRIPTURES and told them to make sure the governing body received the message, but they still proceed to teach the lie, so I must shed light on the truth.(Luke 11:33) but like I said, I was never baptized as a Jehovah&#39;s witness, I got baptized outside of the organization, so I&#39;m not baptized into any religions or member of any church, so I just actually follow Jesus Christ, he is my only leader(Matthew 23:10) I don&#39;t do churches anymore, he&#39;s going to destroy all the religious sects, you don&#39;t want to be caught in those, no offense 😔(Revelation 18:4) but I love talking to everybody about the Bible anyway, I want everyone to follow Jesus Christ but I just don&#39;t want them to follow man, I just want people to follow the Bible for what it says, quit giving to religious organizations or the church and their business(Jehovah&#39;s gift of everlasting life is free through faith in Jesus Christ Ransom sacrifice) if you want to give gifts of Mercy just give to your neighbor,  do something kind for them, show love to your neighbor,(just treat them like you want to be treated) and not a church or business because Matthew 24 at the beginning Jesus said he was going to destroy the church(or Temple) and in 70AD the church was destroyed that means we no longer have use for the church(you have use for ENCOURAGEMENT from LIKE-MINDED people and ASSOCIATION) now we just FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST(he is OUR HIGH PRIEST) and live by the law of love, what you would have given to the church, give to your neighbors(spread out over many people be a cheerful giver), help someone out in need, even a stranger, help that poor man out, buy some one a meal, give your gifts of Mercy to them, not to a mans business, just follow Jesus Christ(a man asked Jesus a good question, &quot;Who really is my neighbor?&quot; you&#39;d be surprised to find out who Jesus said was actually his neighbor, and it wasn&#39;t the obvious choices for that time period(Luke 10:29-37)), try not to practice sin and teach others about them, that right there is what true freedom is,I didn&#39;t realize it until they actually expelled me, because I saw where Jesus said they would (John 16:2),I just got expelled for preaching the truth and I know I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, so since I just got expelled for preaching the truth, that&#39;s when I understood the real truth and understood I wasn&#39;t meant to go into captivity as a Jehovah&#39;s witnesses(or in a False religion that just USES JEHOVAH GOD&#39;S NAME(after all THEY had tried to PREDICT THE END in 1975, 1925,1914(there might be more actually)and OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE NOT RIGHT(WRONG or FALSE(Deuteronomy 18:20-22), just like the CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST might uses JESUS name, BUT THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERED FALSE RELIGION), they should just use their ACTUAL NAME ,the  &quot;WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION&quot;, IT&#39;S AN ORGANIZATION, IT&#39;S A BUSINESS, their members build what the GOVERNING BODY( OR ORGANIZATION) want them to build, they slave for the GOVERNING BODY, they are  all just slaving for men, when they could just read the bible for themselves and get the same insight they get and slave for JESUS CHRIST 👑 and JEHOVAH GOD, instead they are under and being led by a &quot;GOVERNING BODY&quot; not Jesus Christ (Matthew 23:10)(TRY TO FIND &quot;GOVERNING BODY&quot; IN THE BIBLE, JUST LIKE YOU CAN&#39;T FIND &quot;TRINITY&quot; IN THE BIBLE (OH THE HIPOCRACY😂), they&#39;re led by seven imperfect men, they slave for them and build their buildings and give them their money and those men add extra requirements that the Bible does not teach, when all Jesus Christ told us to do was preach the good news (Matthew 28:19) not build kingdom halls or churches, just preach the good news, don&#39;t even need a church for that. I recognize though like any false religion, even JW(or the WATCHTOWER ORGANIZATION) have some truth to their teachings, actually they have a lot of Truth in their teachings (I even occasionally share some of their information, like I do other religions, that might contain Bible TRUTH, that they teach) but they also teach lies, all it takes is for one lie to make a RELIGION FALSE, all it took was for Satan to tell one lie to deceive Eve, and believing that one lie cost Adam and Eve their life, stop being deceived by false religion😔<br><br>1John 2<br>🙏27And as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie.

We could have lived forever without ever eating from the tree of Life. Jehovah God said the only reason why Adam and eve died is because they ate from the tree of knowledge (what was the tree of life supposed to accomplish?)<br><br>JEHOVAH tells us:<br>Genesis 3:22<br>Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad.

Jesus was are roadmap, he was born, he was baptized, he died, but then he came back as spiritual creature and made himself known or let himself be seen to those he wanted... because also remember Jesus says in the resurrection we are as Angels (Angels are spiritual creatures)<br><br>Matthew 22<br>In reply Jesus said to them: “You are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God;  30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven Regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said:  32 ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living( You know Jesus can&#39;t lie and faithful servants of Jehovah and followers of Jesus Christ are supposed to be resurrected if we die, just as Jesus came back as the Angels are(in the spiritual form) after he was put to death, all baptized Christians will come back as the Angels are and if they are not baptized they&#39;ll be resurrected during the 1000 years so they can be baptized so they can then get that spiritual body to be as the angels... because the Bible also says in Revelation that not everybody&#39;s gets resurrected during a thousand years, there are some that come to life after the thousand years where ended<br><br>Revelation 20<br>And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years. 5 (THE REST OF THE DEAD DID NOT COME TO LIFE UNTIL THE 1,000 YEARS WERE ENDED.)<br><br>Matthew 5:8<br>Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.(Jesus already told us servants of Jehovah will actually see God and Jesus can&#39;t lie just like Jehovah can&#39;t tell a lie and the Bible is God&#39;s word)<br><br>❤️❤️Galatians 5 On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is LOVE, JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITH,  23 MILDNESS, SELF-CONTROL.

If you consider the amount of work freelancers have to put in and the structural limitations they experience, I feel it&#39;s only fair to try to compensate them fairly for that, not just in relative terms, but in absolute value (or close to it) as well. I know this kind of advice comes from books like the 4-Hour Work Week, but honestly the ideas in that book have a very ruthless, outdated, almost neo-colonial vibe to them. Yes, inequalities exist and there&#39;s only so much we can do to fix them (to be clear I don&#39;t expect Ali to fix the problems of the world lol), and more often than not people will choose to take advantage of said inequality if it means making their lives easier. The reality is that that&#39;s become a norm, but honestly I wish that wasn&#39;t the case. I just worry that this piece of advice is such a recurring recommendation on your channel, especially in a time where people don&#39;t just need the bare minimum, but need empathy and any fair valuation of labor they can get.

Fear creates resistance which creates more fear and it becomes an increasingly stronger cycle.\r<br>- The solution is to interpret fear as a signal – fear is your compass. The more scared you are of something, the more important it is to you.\r<br>- Become a Professional. A Pro understands fear and failure is part of the process, they show up to work no matter what, resistance is the daily battle. Conversely, an amateur&#39;s actions are mood-driven and goals are often extrinsic and hedonic (fun, money and status). \r<br>- Hence, also make sure your goals are process goals (i.e. upload 2 videos every week), which are things you can control vs. outcome goals (get 1 mil subscribers) which are nice and to be celebrated but not the point.

U will most likely work longer than that but approach truly like its fine even if U worked just for 1 hour today.<br>Reduce your goal and the sense of how well the work has to be. Once U reduce this self afflicted burden of setting urself a high goal, the work automatically becomes less intimidating<br>If the work itself is very Twisted and difficult. Focus on simplifying it first. Focus on the simple stuff. Do it first. And for the rest of the work, Simplify and make it like manageable list of this and that and that.. the steps that U write be as simple as possible, that aim to detangle the complicated issue into more straighter, manageable steps. <br>You are not a procrastinator the way U approach the work leads U to that feeling of resistance, lighten Up Ur Aim, make it easy for yourself, focus on only task for next 1 hour, make things simpler, Ask yourself how can I do this task the most most easiest way...And voila..

Fear creates resistance which creates more fear and it becomes an increasingly stronger cycle.<br>- The solution is to interpret fear as a signal – fear is your compass. The more scared you are of something, the more important it is to you.<br>- Become a Professional. A Pro understands fear and failure is part of the process, they show up to work no matter what, resistance is the daily battle. Conversely, an amateur&#39;s actions are mood-driven and goals are often extrinsic and hedonic (fun, money and status). <br>- Hence, also make sure your goals are process goals (i.e. upload 2 videos every week), which are things you can control vs. outcome goals (get 1 mil subscribers) which are nice and to be celebrated but not the point. The point is to trust the process and do the work.', 'Thanks Ali.💡', 'Happy april fool ali', 'Oh Ali! How well you pretend as if you follow what you preach to beat procrastination.

Trying to juggle sooo much and tired of forgetting all the pieces. lol. Anyway, yes, so important to be compassionate with ourselves in a balanced way of pushing past the uncomfortable to &#39;get where we want to go&#39; (starting rituals and &#39;done is better than perfect&#39; attitude to GTD help too)... and letting go of some &#39;good&#39; things to make sure we have enough room for the &#39;better&#39; stuff. Boundaries is a good newish word for me. Around my time and my energy. I&#39;ve had to &#39;parent&#39; myself around sleep. (I love knowing there is a term for the trap I fall into... &#39;revenge....??&#39; lol.) Though sometime&#39;s I get stuck in a rabbit hole of research about good stuff and am up way too late. I realize I am not as productive as I think I am when I&#39;m doing &#39;work&#39; that gets in the way of a restorative nights sleep. Bottom line, we are all works in progress and we need to give ourselves a break and not beat us up when we fall short. Just keep going. Generally, our body is telling us when we need to realign our priorities by responding in the way you describe. Our central nervous system needs some attention. We go go go... and realize we are out of balance and without taking time for &#39;self care&#39; routines. We will be forced by our natural physical response (pain, illness, fatigue, brain fog... etc.) to slow the heck down. I&#39;ve spent a couple years dealing with CPTSD and trauma that I didn&#39;t know I had... until I &#39;shut down&#39; and had to go on a path of discovery because I didn&#39;t want to remain in the state I was in. I think all of us need to come to a place of &#39;awareness&#39; at some point in life in order to truly derive a sense of completion and satisfaction and connection to ourself and the world. A couple foundational books for me: &#39;The Artist&#39;s Way&#39; (for every human and ESPECIALLY if you have already decided to take on a creative endeavor like writing a book)... The Body Keeps the Score (about how our body holds onto trauma... little or big... and how to release it). &#39;Doing the Work&#39; by Dr. Nicole La Pera - even if you do not have trauma in your life... what you are talking about, being in touch and connected to yourself and dealing with self and others, this book helps us all get in better touch with ourselves. Recognize the discomfort we and others may feel through patterns of thought and behavior we may be unconscious about. Her Instagram as the &#39;Holistic Psychologist&#39; help shift thought paradigms around and about dealing with ourselve and others. How to set better thought patterns and truly be our authentic selves and give space for others to do the same. Anyway, I truly am thankful for your &#39;verbal processing&#39; videos as well as all of the helpful productivity shares you provide. Sharing what works for you (in real case application) is so helpful. I think as you keep doing what your &#39;gut&#39; is telling you to do, even if it breaks a mold (especially if it does)... it will resonate with the folks who need it. Being &#39;real&#39; and authentic helps other&#39;s realize they are not so different after all... we all can connect to each other&#39;s humaness and it creates a sense of community.

The past winterbreak moving to 2022, I was in the college dorms alone. I wanted to make sure I was happy and did fun things, and not stress about being productive. I counted the days of my break. There were 27 days, and each day I would post pictures about my day in one post on instagram. It’s like the most story worth moment of the day exercise. It could be as mundane as I ate a snowman cookie from Starbucks or reading a book. Or literally just a picture of my lunch. I wasn’t aiming for anything big. I just wanted to appreciate each day I had of the break. Normally breaks go by too quickly, and I would feel I didn’t do enough. But by counting the days, I inadvertently focused on things that really mattered. At the start of the break my goal was to study blender and CAD. By the end I was happy I tried making bread for the first time, and made an origami Yoda. ^^ I feel like I started off 2022 very happy because of this, and also connected more with friends as I remembered more interactions each day.', '☘️❤️🙏', '🍀', '🍀<br>I found this extremely relatable.

So funny, because earlier this day I was thinking about my productivity system and how I see it:<br><br>The first step is time management when you start to play with scheduling and then observing and analyzing how things work for you. Then you start to notice that it&#39;s not all about your time, but about your mood, too. <br><br>This brings you to step 2, where you start doing mood management. You are trying to find out what &amp; how influences your mood waves. You are working on how to successfully riding your waves of energy and trying to reduce the time when you are in curve dropping, so the drops are smaller and smaller.<br><br>But then it comes to step no. 3, which I call &quot;holistic productivity&quot;. Here it&#39;s not only about work that has to be done, but connecting all your main &quot;life areas&quot; in a way you feel satisfied. Because even if you&#39;re productivity ninja during your work time, and then you are too tired to play with your kids, or without the energy for doing something you like, or you just don&#39;t feel satisfied with your day before you go to bed, in the long run, you&#39;ll become less productive. In this step, we understand we don&#39;t need to (or better we&#39;re not supposed to be) productive all the time, and be okay with that.<br><br>I believe the main goal is to find the balance between &quot;working&quot; and &quot;being&quot;.<br><br>Wish you all the best!🍀', '🍀', 'Thank you sooo much at least there are some content creators on YouTube apart from America??????', 'Thank you sooo much at least there are some content creators on YouTube apart from America??????', 'Thank you sooo much at least there are some content creators on YouTube apart from America??????', 'Thank you sooo much at least there are some content creators on YouTube apart from America??????', 'Thank you sooo much at least there are some content creators on YouTube apart from America??????', 'I can very much relate!', '☘️ Thank you for being awesome', '♥', '☘️', '🍀 I’m enjoying the rambley talking videos.', '🍀 great honest video!

I had to learn this the hard way, as the only effect my countless effort had on me were amplifying my self criticism and actually achieving nothing. I had a history with depression, got over it, mustered my life together, applied to hard school, was having fun, but the work was a bit too overhelming I would say and I therefore sought help. Sought it here. But somehow (and I&#39;m, ofcourse, not blaming you, this is something fucked up inside my head) the only result I had after trying all the things offered was to just return back to the old inefficient life to actually muster up some results... Only now I feel like I&#39;m doing everything wrong and I can no longer appreciate what I loved to do (which was just being goofy around math/physics and having fun while doing it).

What are the two? There is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable. Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to Nibbana.&#39; — Gautama Buddha<br><br>When you set firm resolutions to improve yourself, you might be tempted to push your limits well outside of what you’re capable of doing. Ambitiousness is a virtue, but there’s danger involved in going from one extreme to another.<br><br>If you’re currently struggling to be productive, don’t force yourself to work sixteen hours a day. If you’re struggling to control your appetite, don’t impose a week-long fast. If you can’t find it in you to choose the stairs over the elevator, don’t expect that you’ll maintain a workout plan that requires you to work out every single day.<br><br>Find the middle path, stick to it for at least several weeks, and then, based on the results you get, decide whether you can further stretch your limits or require more time before advancing.<br><br>As much as I believe in pushing your boundaries and exploring the extremes, you don’t need to put yourself through mortification to  achieve good results. Subjecting yourself to extreme hardships has some merits, but over the long term it’s unsustainable, if not downright dangerous.<br><br>Remember that there should be moderation in all things, including moderation itself. Sometimes a more extreme approach is needed for a short period of time, and sometimes it’s beneficial to set your goals lower. In whatever you do, seek to not spend too much time loafing around, but also make sure that your life hasn’t turned into the life of a self-flagellating ascetic.&quot;<br><br>~ by Meadows Martin, from the book: 365 Days With Self-Discipline: 365 Life-Altering Thoughts on Self-Control, Mental Resilience, and Success<br><br>I thought about you Ali, after watching this video and reading this daily entry of the book, so hope it helps, something...

Being productive gives you more relaxation and thinking time. Most of us are lucking to get one thing done a day we are pleased with. You do so much and then beat yourself up when you feel that you haven’t produced any output. Being creative is not something you can always timetable so strictly.

I am blessed in that I and/or my spouse have had an employer who provided us with insurance our entire adult lives. My sister never did (dead now).

She was among the &quot;working poor&quot; whose income was too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford health insurance. I didn&#39;t live the nightmare, but I watched it.

God had to get them out of the garden and in that he told man that he woul take the fruit of the ground ( the thing he must do to live, basically battle to live, totally contrary to the abundance of the garden) with great effort with thorns of the plants  ...<br>In the garden they got every type of tree to eat is fruit ( yeah, vegan)... but when both man and woman ate from the tree that God told it would bring them death, they were exhiled from the presence of God , before that tho God put on them, cover them, clothed them with the skin of animals... <br>yes, the first sacrifice of an animal was from God... they tried to cover themselves after they ate from the tree and were ashamed of each other with plants... but it wasn&#39;t enough.<br><br>Their to sons Cain and Abel offered to God. <br>Cain offered fruit from the ground and Abel offered the firstborns of his flock and grease. <br>Cain offered from the work he was supposed to do, Abel didn&#39;t he offered something wich wasn&#39;t eaten at the time, something wich God insinuated and protected manhood with. <br>Later in the story we see Abraham (God permited us to eat meat by this point), Abraham disobeyed God, God promised to Abraham at his old age He would give him a son, but his wife and he tried to have one with the slave of his wife and later God asks him to sacrifice his first born son, Isaac,  wich he gaved to him and his wife, by the 2 of them just as He promised .<br>On the way up the mountain he was going to sacrifice him, Isaac asked Abraham were was the sacrificed, Abraham responded that God woul provide the lamb. As Abraham was going to sacrifice him an angel, a messanger of God, came and told him to stop, he stopped and saw a ram, wich was sacrificed instead of Isaac.<br>We know that the lamb Abraham was expecting was the firstborn beloved and only son of God, sacrificed instead of His Isaac, it was an act of faith that God will pay our wrongdoing because he saw  our brokenheartedness and that our only hope is He. <br>Abel also had that faith.<br>Man can work and travail but desperation in the realization we are going to die no matter how much we work and make is what gets God, in hhat desperation we accept Yeshua/Jesus the salvation of God, the tree of life the only way to be with God again in Eden were our works are in vain in the abundance and mercy of our God. <br>Shalom Ali ( I think is like that) ❤', 'I saw that emoji...but I don&#39;t have that emoji in my keyboard...green', 'Why don&#39;t u move everything to noon time and just sleep all morning.', '☘️☘️', '🍀', '🍀', '🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀', 'Now I know why my email never gets a response.

When your mind says no to the work you genuinely want it to do and simple tasks feel heavy. <br><br>The way around this is by recognising that one desire pulls you away from the other. Stop expecting both the most productive day &amp; the most fun day at the same time. <br><br>You cannot achieve hard work &amp; relaxation on the same day. <br><br>Balance can be found by having structured task focused hard-working early-start days that satisfy the productivity level you want. Challenge yourself to hit an ambitious outcome that is exciting, with the promise of a full rest afterwards. <br><br>Then follow this up with several zero work, fun only, guilt free wasteman days. <br><br>It creates a cycle of work &amp; reward that is more in harmony and is more sustainable.

Your content is not the thing that essentially makes your videos interesting (or at least only partly),  but it is your presentation and fun that infuse it with exuding interest and render it relatable or convincing or interesting in the first place.

I posit that when we come to this dilemma, we should pause for a brief moment and think about how doing something/not doing something will impact our future and prioritize our thoughts and feelings accordingly. That way we can decide whether we care enough to get something done or put it off for another time.

Lately I’ve been kicking myself for not being ‘as productive’ as I would like. I’m working to build routines and time-blocks to manage my time and resources more effectively, and the progress seems to be frustratingly slow going. I have this expectation that I’ll be some sort of productivity master by the end of the month. Which I know isn’t any good- but that’s where my mind falls. I know for a fact that my discipline could still use some work. Knowing when to tell myself (and others) ‘no’ and not feel like a bad person for doing it. In all honesty I’m just trying to cobble together something that will help me become a little less of a ‘waste-man’. My mind often swims with so many possibilities with how I can or should spend my time that I end up stalling out and doing nothing, procrastinating till a deadline and cramming to do the best I can. I occasionally have little tastes of what it feels like to be ‘productive’- and then I feel like I take a dip straight after. I’m trying to create a system that’s roughly level, while still being ‘higher performing’ than I’m at right now. Because I know I can do better. It’s just that right now, I feel as though I’m probably focusing more on output goals than input goals- I always have been, honestly. At least up until recently. As an over-achiever I was always more set on the prize at the end rather than the process of how I get there- it’s a hard habit to break.

I still have my original little notebook, which became 3 little 3-ring binders. I switched to composition notebooks where I captured notes, and later maybe 3-4 times per notebook I would type of the notes I wanted added to my digital collection.

A central task list managed by your team?<br>Daily Productivity Stuff - So I check my calendar then like time-blocked tasks I set in my weekly review but realistically I don&#39;t always manage to do all the things that I want to get done? <br>Working with a team - You are doing something really new in a way? your company is essentially built based on your youtube video channel and courses - thus it would be fascinating to see how a team helps you with youtube + how to breakdown the video making process into units that other people can help with? (So say you have write-research-film-edit and you have people doing writing, researching, contacting other content creators, processing email offers and brand offers, organizing the filming and equipment setup, editting and content quality check - how does this all get managed?)<br><br>Other stuff you are doing - A large appeal of your channel to me is seeing the different aspects of a content creator&#39;s lifestyle and I would be interested in content that goes deeper around that. Like how do you decide on how to deal with brand deals, early access offers, somewhat similar to the ethics of sponsorships post that Tom Buck had.

Take action despite imperfect conditions, and don&#39;t let the lack of an ideal setting hold you back.\r<br>\r<br>2. *The Minutes Mindset*: Embrace shorter periods of time as opportunities to be productive. Use those small pockets of time during the day to make progress on your goals instead of waiting for longer, uninterrupted hours.\r<br>\r<br>3. *The Lily Pad Method*: Instead of tackling your goals sequentially, consider them as lily pads, and jump between them based on your motivation and energy levels. This approach allows for flexibility and prevents feeling overwhelmed.\r<br>\r<br>4. *The Horizon Habit*: Set horizon goals rather than overly specific ones. These are directional goals that provide flexibility, allowing you to adapt and pursue different avenues within a broader focus.\r<br>\r<br>5. *The Piano Precedent*: When faced with choices, consider what advice your 100-year-old self would give. This perspective helps you prioritize meaningful experiences and relationships over immediate productivity.\r<br>\r<br>6. *The Purposeful Approach*: Productivity doesn&#39;t always have to relate to work or economic output. Identify &quot;soft goals&quot; that bring you personal satisfaction and meaning, even if they may not appear productive to others.\r<br>\r<br>7. *The 100-Year-Old Plan*: Imagine yourself at 100 years old to gain long-term perspective and make decisions that align with your future self&#39;s advice, focusing on what truly matters in life.', 'Hi, do you know the name of the book in Spanish ?', 'I’m crying.

The speaker, Ali Abdaal, who is a doctor turned entrepreneur, introduces five science-backed methods to achieve this goal.<br><br>The first method is mental contrasting, which involves contrasting your present reality with your desired future to create a sense of urgency and motivation. The second method is implementation intentions, which involves creating if-then statements to plan how you will overcome obstacles that might hinder you from achieving your goals.<br><br>The third method is reducing environmental friction, which involves designing your environment to make it easier to do the things you want to do and avoid the things you don&#39;t want to do. The fourth method is monitoring and tracking, which involves tracking your progress to stay motivated and make adjustments as needed.<br><br>The fifth method is finding ways to make what you&#39;re doing more enjoyable or energizing. This can involve incorporating play, power, and people into your activities to make them more fun and engaging.<br><br>Overall, the video emphasizes that discipline is not about willpower, but about creating systems and habits that make it easier to do the things you want to do.

Right next to them. There have been many times in my life, for either myself or my children, that we needed urgent medical care, it couldn’t wait until morning or until Monday, but we didn’t need an emergency either, we just needed to see a doctor right away. So we greeted our teeth, and clutched our wallet and headed to the ER (where we really didn’t need or want to be, and definitely didn’t want to pay for $150 urgent care vs $4,000 ER for the same treatment). Had there been an urgent care clinic open in the middle of the night I would have gone there.   <br>    So here’s how it would work. Patients come in. They see a receptionist (who has enough medical training to tell the difference between those needing urgent care vs emergency care and then directs them where they need to go.  This should take a fair amount of strain off of emergency rooms, especially during flu season. And if someone happens to go in for something that seems minor but turns out to be major, well they are still right next to the emergency room, and they can either quickly wheel them over, or call the ER for help.  Honestly it would also be a good idea to have a separate area just for infections patients too, so that way people having strokes and heart attacks also won’t get COVID or influenza while they are in the waiting room or ER. There should also be a nurse or emt assigned just to the waiting room. They can even start administering care if needed. There have been several times I have gone to the ER because I couldn’t breath (asthma), or anxiety attacks, sometimes both, and I honestly thought I was going to die right there in the waiting room. It is really, really scary waiting 45 -60 minutes to see a doctor when you cannot breath or are having an active anxiety attack. Unfortunately when you are young, people never seem to think your emergency are as urgent as older people’s. Also get some bed in the waiting room! When I had appendicitis when I was a teenage I laid on the tile floor in the ER waiting room for over 30 minutes, balling my guts out trying not to dye. I couldn’t even sit stand or walk. It’s one thing if the medical emergency is traumatizing, but the emergency room, (or waiting room),  itself should never be the cause of trauma, but for me poor care and treatment at ERs has been much more traumatic then the actual emergencies. Also all maternity/prenatal emergencies should be sent to labor/delivery units (even if the mother is not in labor), because these emergencies need gynecologists and specialized equipment that ERs don’t have.', 'I get the last part as treat yourself like a robot, however I respectfully would like to change the pov. Instead we should treat ourself like a human being (most of the time we dont or forget). As humans we need that time of rest, being mindful of what we absorb in our mind and body, giving time for us to observe our feelings etc. And as for this subject we treat ourselves as human beings to progress and live life to the fullest with the amount of time we have as a human.

It may sound a bit weird or that I&#39;m just a silly highschool student in Germany, I mean what could I do wrong? I get up, go to school in less than 5 minutes, eat, study, sleep, repeat?. But I struggle deeply with procrastination, and lack of sleep (an average of maybe 5 hours of sleep, sometimes less), I&#39;m often exhausted and just wanna rest. &quot;My rest&quot; so far in my holiday is most of the time Social Media (Youtube and Instagram) and yes, I&#39;m watching this video in my holiday but wanted to study. Last year of school was just really horrible for me and especially my mental health and physical health had suffered from it. I experienced and experience deeply the consequences of a wrong or missing time management and also in general low discipline. I hope in the future I can figure it out, hence be happier and healthier. For real, I don&#39;t know why I wrote all this down here.

Set some goals and celebrate them.\r<br>Embrace the mindset of intentionality: Be mindful of how you use your time.

I was addicted to YouTube and random scrolling  for 10 years. I am not anymore. Here is how I did it and you can to:<br>I made this tool to keep myself accountable. It takes 30 days to rewire the brain,  so I drew a house on a piece of paper with 30 windows in it. In each window, I wrote something inspiring like &quot;you are making more money in less time&quot;, &quot;you are feeling pure-minded&quot;&#39;, find the most desirable sentences for you. Every day before bed, I would paint the window green If I succeeded and red if I did not. You must be absolutely strict with yourself, otherwise it can not work. So, If i would watch half an IG reel, that would be a &quot;red day&quot;. Its incredible just how badly you will want to paint that window green and not red. <br>Other points that can help you:<br>- To our brain, everything is relative, If you have your work open in one desktop and entertainment on the other, you are likely to choose the latter. So, to avoid unintentional entertainment simply remove it. You can use browser extensions that hide things like recommended videos and shorts. <br>- Short form content is diabolic. It&#39;s made to be addictive and I realised if I let myself watch it for a few minutes, in a week it will turn into a few hours. So I never watch it, and so should you. <br>- This is your life now. Its not a detox, its not temporary, so build a system which is sustainable for yourself. For example, I always allow myself watch channels that I am subscribed to, but none of them are addicitive entertainment, they all are educational. Find nieches on YT that only inspire you and give you energy and cut the rest. No recommended feed, ever. <br>- Limiting time does not work, at all. Limit the content instead. Its like saying, I will be a crack addict only for 15 minutes a day. If you allow yourself even a little bit, you will have urges all day and dealing with them is stressful. However, if you quit the addictive behavior completely, you will stop feeling this tension overtime. <br>- If your life is empty, it is naturall to fill the void with unintentional  entertainment. You may feel this void very strongly, and it can be painfull in the beginning, and that is great. Now, to succesfully replace addictive garbage with real life, slowly start adding real activities: fitness, hobbies, friendship, romance, etc. If you do not, it is going to feel empty and you will be constantly tempted to fall back into addiction.\xa0<br><br>We all just want to live. All entertainment is an illusory replacement of doing things. You are normal, you have good intentions, but most of us have fallen to this trap, coming from sillicon valley, that made us to believe it is ok to reduce human experience to scrolling.

Here&#39;s a summary of the key points:\r<br>1. <b>*Prioritization:*</b> Ali stresses the importance of prioritizing tasks and activities based on their importance and impact on one&#39;s goals. He advises against using the phrase &quot;I don&#39;t have time&quot; and instead suggests evaluating what activities are truly a priority. Practical tips include setting clear goals, utilizing daily adventures to identify the most important task for the day, and conducting weekly reviews to assess and plan priorities.\r<br>\r<br>2. <b>*Time Blocking:*</b> This technique involves allocating specific blocks of time in one&#39;s calendar for various tasks, including work, personal activities, and leisure. Ali describes time blocking as a crucial skill for ensuring that important tasks are given dedicated time slots, thus enhancing focus and productivity.\r<br>\r<br>3. <b>*Focus:*</b> Developing the ability to focus is highlighted as essential for effective time management. Ali suggests that improving focus involves practicing single-tasking and reducing distractions. He recommends resources and strategies for enhancing one&#39;s ability to focus, such as reading relevant books and participating in focus improvement courses.\r<br>\r<br>4. <b>*Follow-Through:*</b> The skill of actually doing what one plans to do is discussed as critical for successful time management. Ali talks about the challenges of procrastination and the importance of overcoming them through clarity, courage, and starting tasks. He also emphasizes the role of accountability, both personal and external, in ensuring follow-through on commitments.\r<br>\r<br>5. <b>*Energizing Your Work:*</b> Finally, Ali touches on the importance of finding ways to energize one&#39;s work to prevent burnout and maintain high energy levels. He suggests incorporating elements of play, leveraging personal power, and engaging with people to make work more enjoyable and energizing.\r<br>\r<br>Throughout the video, Ali provides personal insights, practical tips, and resources to help viewers manage their time more effectively, emphasizing the goal of not just being more productive but also leading a balanced and fulfilling life.gpt4', 'What to do if you really struggle with time blocking?<br><br>The problem is that I can&#39;t put my mind to the task when the block starts and when I do get in the flow or eager to finish the task, I really struggle with ending in time.

Break a task into chunks and time block accordingly.<br><br><br>From my personal experience:<br>1. Based on time block use pomodoro yt music, Siri for reminding task.<br>2. Add widget of google calendar on your Mac.<br>3. Use Box method where at a time focus completely on one part of task..<br>4. Most important identify your Energy Levels throughout the day and plan tasks accordingly. For me morning and Evening are best time for doing harder cognitive task. During the noon my Energy levels are low and I do task like apply for internships, reply to mails, cook meals for night etc<br>5. Make sure to review your week.<br>6.
