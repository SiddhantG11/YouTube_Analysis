T6hmdrsLQj8,How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,"11:06 aaaahh if this phrase was only a hyperbole... but it literally happened to me, and i think it will never be ""cured"", is just how the brain is programmed. i think i've memorized the obstacle is the way almost entirely, everytime i ready it feels familiar and i know the next phrase likes pieces falling perfectly in place in a cascade (especially if i reread a couple of times after a layoff) but the problem is: i can't remember by my own! everything comes fluidly reading out loud but if i had to recite from heart i would suddenly forget big chunks of it.if you ever did singing classes - or simply sang with the music - you know how much more easier it to find the tone when the song is on or there's a coach is doing with you, but once he/she asks you to go by yourself... *gulp* you're in a bit of a pickle. that's because doing by yourself is much more harder and weaknesses of yours are exposed, you naturally start to notice things about yourself, about your pattern of thinking and your technique that you don't notice normally, there's much more presence and self awareness.after using active recall in past few months i realized how much more different it is from passively reading, there's a more intense ""imagery"", you have to use much more brain power to remember and at times feels like you are physically exerting yourself to pull something. but your ideas feels more powerful, permanent, and this different feeling gives you confidence that you don't get with the old way (it's kinda common sense to be honest, like the principle of specificity in power/olyliftiing). if you ever played chess you had a similar feeling of mentally exausting but this also make you remember and progress surprinsingly faster.""to get stronger you have to compete"" as everyone in chess says,  they knew the nature of learning for a loooong time.",404,negative

T6hmdrsLQj8,How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,"2:14 i want so much for much for that not to be true but gosh, trying to keep up with future and past events while also trying to live in the present is just too hard, you'll end up getting too sucked in a task or forgetting things, getting distrated.the basis for all of our brain functioning is the ability to do things without thinking, to be mostly on system 1, on automatic habitual mode. if you tried to use your system 2 for everything your brain would be completely fried! (thanks core a).now i had an epiphany that is okay to forget what i have to do, what it is important and why, and losing an absurd amount of time getting distracted. it's just how our brain normally works so we external cues to keep us in trap, even someone who lives on a harsh envinronment, it's not like they have more discipline, it's just that pretators, lack of water, cold climate forces them to act in a certain way (like military man on power of habits who changed food tends out of place and people couldn't mob anymore or arrakis and salusa secundus - ""author frank herbert was very interest in how envinronment affects people and how people affects their envinronment"" - just like we lose muscle if we stop training cause they are just useless energy expenditure now, a fremen wouldn't need to keep high alertness for danger and be utterly stricty with water use if they started living in caladan. they would inevitably lose discipline cause there's no sandworns there and there's water fucking everywhere! so is okay accept forgetfulness and procrastination impulses and to rely on external tools to keep us in track of what we do and why, and to remind us what is important to us. it's not a sign of weakness. and for someone as maniac with control as me i think i need to start to think of it like eating food, something external that i can't just stop using cause i want to self sufficient. at the end of the day, we are connected to the universe and need its products.",434,negative

FbSNfj2S6Pw,5 Essential Tips for Long-Lasting Productivity,"as i am in the process of writing my own book based on the time management trainings i have developed and delivered, i'll share just a few extremely powerful thoughts:  first, 'productivity' has absolutely nothing to with 'getting more things done'. (this a wide misconception, as vast numbers of people fill their lives with mountains of busy work, only to wind up with little to show for it.) secondly, productivity has little to do with 'doing what is important'. (one's list of 'important' to-do's' is potentially infinite. therefore, attempting to work through that list can also be potentially futile.) the key to true productivity is to begin to view time as a resource you are perpetually being forced to invest. you do not have a choice, one way or the other, as to whether, or not, you will invest your time. you will, as long as you are alive. you only have a choice regarding where you invest it. therefore, a sober and honest assessment of what your potential return on investment is likely to be should start to dictate how and where you spend your time. a good empowering question to ask is, ""how is this action related to the fulfillment of my highest values and goals?"" if something doesn't support your highest values, and the actual achievement of goals that are aligned with those values, you may want to question if it is an investment worthy of your time.",288,neutral

tQSKyvjsUuI,My Complete Productivity System,"to ecfmg from doctors and medical students of russia, belarus, ukraine and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states. on the 31st of march 2022, on international doctor’s day, ecfmg has banned for an unknown period of time  all russian doctors, based on their citizenship, and nationality from taking usmle exams and obtaining an ecfmg certificate which is needed for applying to us residency. interestingly,  we found out about this decision by accident. one of our fellow colleagues had a call to solve routine questions regarding their application and found out that his documents are no longer processed because of his russian citizenship. ecfmg representatives later confirmed their decision and added that they will not publicly announce it on their website or social media. we are not able to pay, or register for the exams usmle step 1 or usmle ck. those who have already passed these steps will not be able to go through any ecfmg certification pathways. that means that the absolute majority of russian citizens won’t be able to take usmle exams at all, without exemptions. this ban applies even for russians with dual citizenship, even if it is ukrainian or us, russians who have political asylum in the us or any other country and even for foreign citizens, who currently reside in russia. ban is based solely on our citizenship and national origin, not on our personal choice, beliefs or actions taken during these tough political times. years of hard work we put into studying medicine, self improving and preparing for medical residency in the us are ruined by this quiet decision of ecfmg officials. our work has simply been portrayed as unimportant, all due to political issues that we, in fact, have no control over. throughout the last month we have signed numerous petitions against this war, putting ourselves at risk. please, take pity on us, we are simple doctors, looking to practice medicine and save lives in peace. it’s a discrimination of russian citizens based on country of origin. russian doctors signed petition  against the war and more than 17 500 signed",439,negative

iONDebHX9qk,How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips,"2:06 but it's more than this, it also includes things that you would really love to do and things that you look like a fool by saying no because their of less priority. this is actually something really painful to me at times, specially when i have a bunch of things that can't say no to learn, like cooking, communication and self control, things that i don't actually care or don't have intrinsic value right now take priority because 1. if i don't learn how to feed myself i'll die, 2. i can't just tell people what to do and expect they'll do it (believe me, i tried, more times than i'm confortable admiting) and 3. i cannot lose my shit everytime people don't do what i say or something unexpected happen that derails my routine or progress.the things that i'm most passionate about are sports (play/study), mind games (stories/gambles) and judgement under uncertainty study. those things would be hell yeah all the time, but i also need to eat, sleep and study things that will keep me alive and functional. so it can be a really hard decision actually, involves sacrificing time for what your really liked to be doing for a greater good (like me watching this video when i don't care about being organized and ""productive"" because this is time taken from what i love, but i discovered that doing this without a plan don't work).but it's important to know that you can change your priorities over time, therefore changing what becomes a hell yeah or no, allowing to do what you want.",328,negative

iONDebHX9qk,How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips,"hey ali, can you make a video talking about how long it actually takes to building extra sources of income to the point of it actually producing regular income?so many vids on yt talk about starting side hustles, for example, but starting a thing on the side vs making regular extra money from it are two different things.i have a blog and a podcast, and i haven't made any money yet! blogging is much harder than ppl make it out to be - not just because of all the work of blogging, but having to be thrown into the world of seo that most ppl don't know about until they start a blog. that's how everything seems to be tho. you think it's just one thing - but it's the tip of the iceberg. even if it's dropshipping or starting a regular e-commerce store - the process is much harder than just creating an account. you have to know how to run ads/marketing, have money for those ads to run daily, research products to sell, order samples, etc, etc.please do a video all about the process and how long it takes to make money from each income stream.cheers",241,neutral

""how much is my time worth? more than yours because i live somewhere else."" wtf.  if someone in the uk said to you ""let's hire a woman, because we don't have to pay them as much"" you would, hopefully, object.  it's no different.2. parents, mums specifically: you are not in control of your time.  do not feel bad.  you no longer dictate where your time goes.  productivity gurus will cite the exception to the rule and say ""if you say ""we are having dinner at this time, then you're having dinner at that time"", but we all know that doesn't happen.  yes, we can manage our time better and develop parenting strategies to make our days a bit smoother, but that's not going to work all the time. the time that is ours, is after bedtime.  sometimes.  depending on illness, kids' personalities, your job, etc.",246,negative

iONDebHX9qk,How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips,"hi ali,almost everywhere is recommended to use an external display with your laptop for better ergonomics better productivity etc.so i don't know if i am the crazy one... but i hate working on my external monitor because it fatigues my eyes so much. i have macbook pro m1 and lg ultrafine 4k display. when i am on my monitor my eyes start to hurt i feel like i have to focus more to read text on the screen. it's very good for a creative task like editing videos or working with photoshop. but when i am doing just casual office work (emails, browsing the internet...) then i prefer doing it on a smaller laptop screen because it's easier on my eyes. so because most of my work is casual office work then i would be better without spending money on the monitor. my wife is experiencing the same and prefers an m1 macbook air screen to a larger lg ultrafine. i think it could be because you are just staring into a larger glowing screen... it would seem intuitive. but none of the tech youtubers is talking about it.what's your honest experience with this phenomenon?",235,negative

iONDebHX9qk,How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips,"man, as a filipino it honestly it makes me kind of sad when you mention the philippines cause of its cheap labor :( i know it's tempting to pay people just 7 usd an hour and feel like you're still doing them a favor, but i can assure you that those people would really appreciate a higher rate if the person hiring them could afford it and especially if they found the work really valuable to them. if you consider the amount of work freelancers have to put in and the structural limitations they experience, i feel it's only fair to try to compensate them fairly for that, not just in relative terms, but in absolute value (or close to it) as well. i know this kind of advice comes from books like the 4-hour work week, but honestly the ideas in that book have a very ruthless, outdated, almost neo-colonial vibe to them. yes, inequalities exist and there's only so much we can do to fix them (to be clear i don't expect ali to fix the problems of the world lol), and more often than not people will choose to take advantage of said inequality if it means making their lives easier. the reality is that that's become a norm, but honestly i wish that wasn't the case. i just worry that this piece of advice is such a recurring recommendation on your channel, especially in a time where people don't just need the bare minimum, but need empathy and any fair valuation of labor they can get. especially considering the fact that developing countries are truly truly struggling to get back on their feet because to the pandemic. i know you don't mean any ill, ali, and are just sharing what works for you. i just hope this kind of advice is delivered with a little more sensitivity or at least not given out without some kind of discussion of these realities. i am a longtime fan of your content and your channel, i just hope this constructive critique reaches you and perhaps serves as some food for thought. wishing you the best, man!",408,negative

RP0oVOH4Zz4,How to Beat Procrastination,"true opinion!!most of the things that he says here are going to make procrastination even worst. he kind of says some point right of course but again to sum up relies heavily on the notion of powering through that resistance.better way to approach procrastination!!if u feel resistance, focus on reducing the resistance and the load factor, not focus on increasing your effort.eg: if i don't feel like working today, its fine, i will just work for 1 hour today.. or 2 hours. u will most likely work longer than that but approach truly like its fine even if u worked just for 1 hour today.reduce your goal and the sense of how well the work has to be. once u reduce this self afflicted burden of setting urself a high goal, the work automatically becomes less intimidatingif the work itself is very twisted and difficult. focus on simplifying it first. focus on the simple stuff. do it first. and for the rest of the work, simplify and make it like manageable list of this and that and that.. the steps that u write be as simple as possible, that aim to detangle the complicated issue into more straighter, manageable steps. you are not a procrastinator the way u approach the work leads u to that feeling of resistance, lighten up ur aim, make it easy for yourself, focus on only task for next 1 hour, make things simpler, ask yourself how can i do this task the most most easiest way...and voila.. see the magic happen.and of course rely on a schedule rather than on motivation.",321,negative

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,"this was really refreshing and helpful ali. i've been trying to make videos and been super hard on myself whenever i missed an opportunity because i'm too tired or unmotivated. i think it is true that we need to push ourselves regardless of our emotional state sometimes, especially when we know that what we are doing is worth it and that we care about it. at the same time, it is a challenge to not get burned out when we are perfectionists. which is why i really find your point about being input-focused helpful in that regard, because it reduces the amount of energy, stress and anxiety surrounding things that we simply cannot control. all in all, thanks for this video where you let us be part of your (and our own) therapy :shamrock:",157,positive

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,":four_leaf_clover:. i can totally relate to this. similar background + a lot going on all at once + bad judge of my own emotional state yada yada. anyway, when i feel overwhelmed and not able to do something wholeheartedly, i take a break and enjoy the break a 100% (be it playing a game/ going out for a cuppa coffee with a friend/ just watching something). that way when i actually get back to work, i feel very refreshed. for me, i get more done within 1.5 hours x 100% focus than 6 hours of guilt-ridden forced productivity. also, one of my mentors asked me to document what i do hourly along with what i am thinking/feeling at that point in time. this helps me be more present in the sense that i kinda know what i am feeling and what i should do in the next hour to change the way i feel (you get the gist ;)).may be the above helps or may be it doesn't. just my two cents.i'll give your solutions a shot too - thanks!anyway, keep them videos coming!  :d \\m/",239,negative

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,"hey ali, great video, love your honesty about this topic! so funny, because earlier this day i was thinking about my productivity system and how i see it:the first step is time management when you start to play with scheduling and then observing and analyzing how things work for you. then you start to notice that it's not all about your time, but about your mood, too. this brings you to step 2, where you start doing mood management. you are trying to find out what & how influences your mood waves. you are working on how to successfully riding your waves of energy and trying to reduce the time when you are in curve dropping, so the drops are smaller and smaller.but then it comes to step no. 3, which i call ""holistic productivity"". here it's not only about work that has to be done, but connecting all your main ""life areas"" in a way you feel satisfied. because even if you're productivity ninja during your work time, and then you are too tired to play with your kids, or without the energy for doing something you like, or you just don't feel satisfied with your day before you go to bed, in the long run, you'll become less productive. in this step, we understand we don't need to (or better we're not supposed to be) productive all the time, and be okay with that.i believe the main goal is to find the balance between ""working"" and ""being"".wish you all the best!:four_leaf_clover:",311,positive

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,"hey, i was watching your videos really often before and they changed the way i approached learning. that was really helpful. somewhere along the way i stopped watching them because i too felt like i was concerned about productivity too much. i really like your chit-chat videos. i sometimes just like to hear what is going on in other peoples lifes, especially when i feel like i know them through their older videos.i am glad that you were able to change your approach and feel less stressed. i just wanted to say that your life is not just a list of achivements. it sounded a little like you were trying to be less stressed just to be able to be more productive as a result. i think you are a really cool person regardless of what you achive in your day or in life in general.also while your at it, i think your relationship with love and marriage might also be a little bit toxic. xd you might want a wife and that is fine. but don't try to change just so people find you more attractive. you are such a cool person. (that's why i watch your videos.) you don't have to gain muscles or be more flirty or less nerdy. just be yourself, you're already great. you don't need to take art lessons. of course you can do that if you want to. in the end we are all just idiots and we will always be idiots. and we will all die and nothing will matter anymore.so just be the idiot you want to be and be happy. maybe i am procrastinating in writing this comment.

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,"i know this feeling so very well. it comes from having promised yourself two very separate lives that can’t really coexist. when you were at your day job you thought about how much more productive you would be if only you could work full-time on youtube. you also likely daydreamed about how relaxing and free your day would be to have a lie in or be able to choose your own schedule. these are opposites. the truth is you will never be as productive with your time as when you worked a day job and had a solid focus on the small few hours you had control over. as much as you loved that level of productivity it required a level of energy that wasn’t sustainable and you dreamed of getting a break from. this now leaves you unhappy with your level of productivity as you are free to do less but still unsatisfied that you are not achieving more. you are also now getting backlash from the part of your mind that you promised would be allowed more of a rest. you will resent the things that you have to get up for as your body says “i was promised this life would be more restful and it’s not”. that is the start of burn out. when your mind says no to the work you genuinely want it to do and simple tasks feel heavy. the way around this is by recognising that one desire pulls you away from the other. stop expecting both the most productive day & the most fun day at the same time. you cannot achieve hard work & relaxation on the same day. balance can be found by having structured task focused hard-working early-start days that satisfy the productivity level you want. challenge yourself to hit an ambitious outcome that is exciting, with the promise of a full rest afterwards. then follow this up with several zero work, fun only, guilt free wasteman days. it creates a cycle of work & reward that is more in harmony and is more sustainable. it fulfils both needs without them competing. you owe yourself a backlog of those rest days first.",416,negative

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,"hey ali! 1st time commenting here. i think your past few videos clearly reflected the lack of passion and inspiration (your face betrays more than you possibly fathom) and i was one among many who either didnt bother clicking them or stopped watching them past the 2nd minute. having that said, keep 2 things in mind: 1) i'd rather watch 1 video per month from you rather than 8 videos where you clearly dont have fun. your content is not the thing that essentially makes your videos interesting (or at least only partly),  but it is your presentation and fun that infuse it with exuding interest and render it relatable or convincing or interesting in the first place. in other words, scarcity hurts your stats way less than you having no fun. 2) i have watched 90% of your videos thus far, ever since the beginning. from an ipad reviewer, you have grown to a productivity guru (and by far the most likeable of them too in my rather firm opinion), and so, even if unwillingly, you now possess  an influencer role. that means that your reflections about toxic productivity (stuff that is not limited to ""mere tips"" and theories), about the essence of productivity itself, the things that actually bother you in your everyday life, bother us, interest us and concerns us all far more than any just use-oriented videos. so please embrace your influencer status and talk freely and openly about whatever you actually wanna share.hope you take your time and read it.a longtime fan and supporter,angel",316,negative

3LXUVa4ugwc,My Toxic Relationship With Productivity,":four_leaf_clover::four_leaf_clover::four_leaf_clover:this was a video i needed to watch. lately i’ve been kicking myself for not being ‘as productive’ as i would like. i’m working to build routines and time-blocks to manage my time and resources more effectively, and the progress seems to be frustratingly slow going. i have this expectation that i’ll be some sort of productivity master by the end of the month. which i know isn’t any good- but that’s where my mind falls. i know for a fact that my discipline could still use some work. knowing when to tell myself (and others) ‘no’ and not feel like a bad person for doing it. in all honesty i’m just trying to cobble together something that will help me become a little less of a ‘waste-man’. my mind often swims with so many possibilities with how i can or should spend my time that i end up stalling out and doing nothing, procrastinating till a deadline and cramming to do the best i can. i occasionally have little tastes of what it feels like to be ‘productive’- and then i feel like i take a dip straight after. i’m trying to create a system that’s roughly level, while still being ‘higher performing’ than i’m at right now. because i know i can do better. it’s just that right now, i feel as though i’m probably focusing more on output goals than input goals- i always have been, honestly. at least up until recently. as an over-achiever i was always more set on the prize at the end rather than the process of how i get there- it’s a hard habit to break. but i’m doing it one step at a time. this video was the reminder i needed not to let myself dive too far down the opposite direction and to just, be kinder to myself. that was needed, for sure. so thank you, ali. it was truly appreciated.",452,negative

K-ssUVyfn5g,How to Organise your Life - Building a Second Brain,"first time watching your video so fast xdvideo ideas: how do you create so much? like your system for actually getting tasks done, thinking through what you have saved and thus creating - i have seen your productivity system video but that was more like separate apps and i am curious how it comes together. previously you have mentioned gtd (as a book you read etc) and apps you use, but i'm curious because i feel like you do so much (it's almost like hermione granger and her time turner). would also be interested in how your extensive team would contribute to the system you have. i watched your previous video on like your days ""filming with aid of your team, having writers and like how you work with your team"" and that was really interesting so i am curious about specifics?  productivity system - do you use a todo list now? weekly reviews (gtd)? a central task list managed by your team?daily productivity stuff - so i check my calendar then like time-blocked tasks i set in my weekly review but realistically i don't always manage to do all the things that i want to get done? working with a team - you are doing something really new in a way? your company is essentially built based on your youtube video channel and courses - thus it would be fascinating to see how a team helps you with youtube + how to breakdown the video making process into units that other people can help with? (so say you have write-research-film-edit and you have people doing writing, researching, contacting other content creators, processing email offers and brand offers, organizing the filming and equipment setup, editting and content quality check - how does this all get managed?)other stuff you are doing - a large appeal of your channel to me is seeing the different aspects of a content creator's lifestyle and i would be interested in content that goes deeper around that. like how do you decide on how to deal with brand deals, early access offers, somewhat similar to the ethics of sponsorships post that tom buck had. on your deep dive podcast, i see you interview other content creators a lot and it would be nice to have a more in-depth look at how you make these decisions too.",454,positive

yxF9TGhWPMc,7 Actionable Ways to Achieve More in Life,"my takeaway :star:!!!!1.  productivity is not pretty: overcome ideal environment dependency, e.g., the parking lot story.2.  embrace the minutes mindset: get the most out of every minute, like when you are waiting at a restaurant.3. the lily pad method: tackle your projects in a non-linear fashion by working on any part you feel like at the moment to maintain momentum and reduce overwhelm.4. plan with horizon goals: goals are just destinations; they shouldn't be a source of stress. this also leads to the idea that horizon goals, such as becoming a writer and doing other billion things related to writing, give you both freedom and resilience.5. five-year plans are inviting the universe to drop a piano on you: when you plan everything, it's bound to have something go wrong. you have your plans on one axis and fate on the other, and the path your life takes is sort of somewhere between these two lines. so, think of plans as these dots on a chart that you will sometimes touch upon.6. the solomon project: spend time journaling with your older self to reflect on what matters to you, to reveal what you want your legacy to be, and your long-term plans.7. the purposeful approach: be productive for the sake of maximizing fun, work, and relationships. don't just think of it in terms of economic output.thank you ali for your enlightening content. following you since 2020:blue_heart:",308,neutral

c_DOG_mXz5w,How to Make 2024 The Best Year of Your Life,"i really enjoyed this video - and it prompted me to purchase the audio version of your book.  i've watched quite a few of your videos, particularly on productivity. what i think would be a great addition to your content would be to include ""templates"" in the video description to make artefacts you discussed in each video so people can start with something rather than a blank paper.  for example:- a sample ideal calendar that people could copy to their own (not sure if this is possible)- template for writing digitally down the wheel of life (click to create based on template)- template for how to write goals (click to create based on template)these might seem like simple things to make, but i think they can make all the difference in getting people to adopt the ideas and put them into practice - particularly if you embed some of the graphics or visual aids you use in the videos and can make it really visually appealing to use. over time these could become part of a digital toolkit that could be used for people and might be a new way to reposition your content into an interactive book that gives people the mental models, but also creates the content and tools to keep them active and current in your life. in the same way that you have previously described about reducing the friction to use these (i think i remember a wireless earphone example in an old video :p).if you get the time i would really like to know if you had tried this before, or whether or not this is something you'd consider :) happy 2024!",310,positive

PCtQ6sipdqA,How to Find Time for Everything with a Full Time Job,"i am so delighted that i found this video because right now i'm faced with my inability to plan my time effectively and manage my days. since the last year of school i'm in a boarding school which is more demanding and requires more effort. but my time management hasn't even existed because school was easy these days and my mom was kinda ""my manager"". therefore i had to figure out by myself since then how to organize my life (my calendar, when do i study, i got confronted with the need to plan studying, my problem of balancing my sleep shedule, my social life and friends, studying so i still get my wanted marks, appointments and so on). it may sound a bit weird or that i'm just a silly highschool student in germany, i mean what could i do wrong? i get up, go to school in less than 5 minutes, eat, study, sleep, repeat?. but i struggle deeply with procrastination, and lack of sleep (an average of maybe 5 hours of sleep, sometimes less), i'm often exhausted and just wanna rest. ""my rest"" so far in my holiday is most of the time social media (youtube and instagram) and yes, i'm watching this video in my holiday but wanted to study. last year of school was just really horrible for me and especially my mental health and physical health had suffered from it. i experienced and experience deeply the consequences of a wrong or missing time management and also in general low discipline. i hope in the future i can figure it out, hence be happier and healthier. for real, i don't know why i wrote all this down here. normally i'm not writing that long comments because who wants to read these long comments, but maybe your video series will help me out with time management. i definitely loved the first part and i'm looking forward to the others. thank you, ali!",385,negative
