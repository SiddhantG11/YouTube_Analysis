"11:06 aaaahh if this phrase was only a hyperbole... but it literally happened to me, and i think it will never be ""cured"", is just how the brain is programmed. i think i've memorized the obstacle is the way almost entirely, everytime i ready it feels familiar and i know the next phrase likes pieces falling perfectly in place in a cascade (especially if i reread a couple of times after a layoff) but the problem is: i can't remember by my own! everything comes fluidly reading out loud but if i had to recite from heart i would suddenly forget big chunks of it.if you ever did singing classes - or simply sang with the music - you know how much more easier it to find the tone when the song is on or there's a coach is doing with you, but once he/she asks you to go by yourself... *gulp* you're in a bit of a pickle. that's because doing by yourself is much more harder and weaknesses of yours are exposed, you naturally start to notice things about yourself, about your pattern of thinking and your technique that you don't notice normally, there's much more presence and self awareness.after using active recall in past few months i realized how much more different it is from passively reading, there's a more intense ""imagery"", you have to use much more brain power to remember and at times feels like you are physically exerting yourself to pull something. but your ideas feels more powerful, permanent, and this different feeling gives you confidence that you don't get with the old way (it's kinda common sense to be honest, like the principle of specificity in power/olyliftiing). if you ever played chess you had a similar feeling of mentally exausting but this also make you remember and progress surprinsingly faster.""to get stronger you have to compete"" as everyone in chess says,  they knew the nature of learning for a loooong time.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5728704929351807, 0.2857224941253662, 0.14140701293945312]"

"pace is good. the vast majority of youtube is too slow but i definitely felt that was just too fast in all but the dumbeldore section.. it's not about the speaker, it's about giving the listener a tiny pause at the end of a section to allow them just to do a little keypoints and value recap on what they just heard. this is really important when communicating learning.  practical tip, count one thousand, two thousand at the end of each section to give the listener time to quickly digest. (and no, viewer pausing is not the answer - learning needs these moments of micro reflection and flow and the presentation does not flow if the viewer has to act as their own  video editor.)","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5538581013679504, 0.24411769211292267, 0.2020242065191269]"

"2:14 i want so much for much for that not to be true but gosh, trying to keep up with future and past events while also trying to live in the present is just too hard, you'll end up getting too sucked in a task or forgetting things, getting distrated.the basis for all of our brain functioning is the ability to do things without thinking, to be mostly on system 1, on automatic habitual mode. if you tried to use your system 2 for everything your brain would be completely fried! (thanks core a).now i had an epiphany that is okay to forget what i have to do, what it is important and why, and losing an absurd amount of time getting distracted. it's just how our brain normally works so we external cues to keep us in trap, even someone who lives on a harsh envinronment, it's not like they have more discipline, it's just that pretators, lack of water, cold climate forces them to act in a certain way (like military man on power of habits who changed food tends out of place and people couldn't mob anymore or arrakis and salusa secundus - ""author frank herbert was very interest in how envinronment affects people and how people affects their envinronment"" - just like we lose muscle if we stop training cause they are just useless energy expenditure now, a fremen wouldn't need to keep high alertness for danger and be utterly stricty with water use if they started living in caladan. they would inevitably lose discipline cause there's no sandworns there and there's water fucking everywhere! so is okay accept forgetfulness and procrastination impulses and to rely on external tools to keep us in track of what we do and why, and to remind us what is important to us. it's not a sign of weakness. and for someone as maniac with control as me i think i need to start to think of it like eating food, something external that i can't just stop using cause i want to self sufficient. at the end of the day, we are connected to the universe and need its products.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.6350998878479004, 0.24210327863693237, 0.12279686331748962]"

"it’s hard to watch ali’s videos now and i love him as a content creator so much. something about the videos seems too much. the editing - too much, the goal to provide value - too much. what this channel needs is for ali to just finish the book. even if that means a temporary absence from youtube with recycled content. finish the book and then come back to us with a creative mind. you don’t have to keep regurgitating old ideas or sticking to the niche that helped you gain the success. you’re an author now. a content creator. talk about what that’s like. how are you managing balance? what kind of things do you do to have a well balanced life in all that you’re juggling? what are some of your guilty pleasures now? what kind of things do you and your friends do? (that might be better for the vlog channel tho) i don’t even know if this helpful. i just want the ali back that didn’t try so hard. i don’t want to feel you trying to give me a lot of value. go back to the “here’s this cool thing that helped me, hopefully it will help you tone.”i just feel like ali and the team are creatively constipated. do a prank war, have fun. get off the wheel for just a second.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5557535290718079, 0.2998303472995758, 0.14441613852977753]"

"i could've helped him discover this a long time ago :face_with_tears_of_joy: after watching several of his videos i definitely started to see that while there are a lot of gidgits, gadgets, and gizmos-- they aren't all necessary. i also started to wonder how much those apps might start getting in the way of actually getting things done. yeah, you have an app that saves articles for later, but that doesn't mean it helps you get through the goal of actually reading the articles you save. to-do lists can be beneficial, but use them too rigidly; you won't want to do anything. being productive definitely comes from an aspirational mindset, and using some (but probably not all) of the widgets can make a dredging experience more novel. that helps you get engaged with the task. those things we don't actually want to do since we are cognitive misers and don't want to expend our mental faculties will probably benefit from a written goal with tangible evidence of completion (e.g., checking it off the list).simply put, you need two big things for productivity-- goals and habits. if you want to become productive, you need to set small goals that encourage your progression to a larger purpose, and you need good habits that keep you on track with those goals. the gizmos are just novel tools that can help and provide inspiration for new ideas. learn where you can incorporate the ones you like and nix the rest. changing your mindset and thinking more positively about the things you are doing will inevitably be more helpful, if not just to curtail stressors.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.8590781092643738, 0.0778995081782341, 0.06302234530448914]"

"can't get through this. what it reminds of is when rich people say to poorer people, ""money isn't everything"".  this whole video smacks of that same blindness to me.  i know nothing about ali abdaal other than watching a few videos, but my guess is he doesn't have children and has never had the stress and worry of being down to your last couple of dollars and trying to scrape together that few more cents so you can buy a loaf of bread for your kids to have something to eat, while you have your telco and other companies chasing your for the bills that are all overdue (oh gee, why don't i just tell myself to have more fun - yeah right ffs). these are all just suggestions (well the two i got through anyway) that are great if you're don't have any real struggle going on, but for those who do have struggle, they make you want to vomit, because the people saying them really have no idea.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.48568063974380493, 0.37444061040878296, 0.1398787945508957]"

(not a native english speaker, sorry for my mistakes)finishing high school, i truly did not know what i want to do with my life. i just chose computer science, as an opportunity to earn ""more than the average"" and try to live abroad (i live in kazakhstan). i mostly chose cs degree only because i spent a lot of time on my computer and playing video games, and did not have any other ""passions"". went to my first university, and just failed 13 out of 14 courses. i was burnt out, had no directions in life, and genuinely gave up on trying to do something. thankfully my parents helped me out and sent me to a psychotherapist. that was a small push, and directions i needed.after months of trying to learn more about myself, i somewhat know what i would like to do with my life:plan a: become a singerplan b: earn money by becoming a game-developerplan c: multiply my money by trying out investmentsplan a is the main plan, because singing makes me feel aliveplan b and c go is what i will do if plan a won't work.so to anyone there not knowing what to do in their life, i will advise you to learn more about yourself, and find things that are satisfying to you. i wish you greatest luck on this journey called life :>.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.7658647894859314, 0.17421983182430267, 0.05991536006331444]"

"as i am in the process of writing my own book based on the time management trainings i have developed and delivered, i'll share just a few extremely powerful thoughts:  first, 'productivity' has absolutely nothing to with 'getting more things done'. (this a wide misconception, as vast numbers of people fill their lives with mountains of busy work, only to wind up with little to show for it.) secondly, productivity has little to do with 'doing what is important'. (one's list of 'important' to-do's' is potentially infinite. therefore, attempting to work through that list can also be potentially futile.) the key to true productivity is to begin to view time as a resource you are perpetually being forced to invest. you do not have a choice, one way or the other, as to whether, or not, you will invest your time. you will, as long as you are alive. you only have a choice regarding where you invest it. therefore, a sober and honest assessment of what your potential return on investment is likely to be should start to dictate how and where you spend your time. a good empowering question to ask is, ""how is this action related to the fulfillment of my highest values and goals?"" if something doesn't support your highest values, and the actual achievement of goals that are aligned with those values, you may want to question if it is an investment worthy of your time.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4126172959804535, 0.38001930713653564, 0.20736342668533325]"

"much of your advice is exceedingly good. however it seems to be primarily geared towards freelancers and/or entrepreneurs. do you have any advice for people who chose to pursue a corporate career rather than entrepreneurship or freelancing - at this stage of their lives. specifically the problem is as follows: in a corporate environment you always have to sign wavers what you can and cannot do especially in digital. here: i am not allowed to share my corporate outlook calendar with my private calendar - it is in fact even disabled to share to anything outside the company network. and reasonably so. that forces me to have two completely different calendars. on private in say phantastical google cal or whatever, and the other in my companies´ outlook. but it is still one seamless life. so i have to constantly adapt - manually (sic!) - . i guess this hard border between two aspects of one life is a problem that many in the corporate world will have. and i certainly have no incentive to have my private appointments and tasks in my company calendar. do you have any advice or ideas on that? maybe a dedicated video? all the best ; martin  :slightly_smiling_face:","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.7293474674224854, 0.13637545704841614, 0.1342770904302597]"

"to ecfmg from doctors and medical students of russia, belarus, ukraine and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states. on the 31st of march 2022, on international doctor’s day, ecfmg has banned for an unknown period of time  all russian doctors, based on their citizenship, and nationality from taking usmle exams and obtaining an ecfmg certificate which is needed for applying to us residency. interestingly,  we found out about this decision by accident. one of our fellow colleagues had a call to solve routine questions regarding their application and found out that his documents are no longer processed because of his russian citizenship. ecfmg representatives later confirmed their decision and added that they will not publicly announce it on their website or social media. we are not able to pay, or register for the exams usmle step 1 or usmle ck. those who have already passed these steps will not be able to go through any ecfmg certification pathways. that means that the absolute majority of russian citizens won’t be able to take usmle exams at all, without exemptions. this ban applies even for russians with dual citizenship, even if it is ukrainian or us, russians who have political asylum in the us or any other country and even for foreign citizens, who currently reside in russia. ban is based solely on our citizenship and national origin, not on our personal choice, beliefs or actions taken during these tough political times. years of hard work we put into studying medicine, self improving and preparing for medical residency in the us are ruined by this quiet decision of ecfmg officials. our work has simply been portrayed as unimportant, all due to political issues that we, in fact, have no control over. throughout the last month we have signed numerous petitions against this war, putting ourselves at risk. please, take pity on us, we are simple doctors, looking to practice medicine and save lives in peace. it’s a discrimination of russian citizens based on country of origin. russian doctors signed petition  against the war and more than 17 500 signed","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5423448085784912, 0.3035776913166046, 0.15407757461071014]"

"maybe this is an unpopular take but it's easier to say this from the lens of a privileged content creator whose job is to film a video whenever they feel like it, and then time is entirely your own. some people truly don't have enough time, my time isn't always my own. what i want to be doing right now is working on my thesis so i can graduate, but instead of doing that i'm clocking in at work because life isn't free. then i have to spend 30 mins in public transport to go to university, work on my thesis for 4 hours, then spend 1 hour going home. and then not only the day is gone, but it is also fairly late by that point, and i could make time for painting, the hobby i'd like to indulge in.so maybe it isn't as simple as saying ""you own your time""","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.45931878685951233, 0.41232991218566895, 0.1283513307571411]"

"2:06 but it's more than this, it also includes things that you would really love to do and things that you look like a fool by saying no because their of less priority. this is actually something really painful to me at times, specially when i have a bunch of things that can't say no to learn, like cooking, communication and self control, things that i don't actually care or don't have intrinsic value right now take priority because 1. if i don't learn how to feed myself i'll die, 2. i can't just tell people what to do and expect they'll do it (believe me, i tried, more times than i'm confortable admiting) and 3. i cannot lose my shit everytime people don't do what i say or something unexpected happen that derails my routine or progress.the things that i'm most passionate about are sports (play/study), mind games (stories/gambles) and judgement under uncertainty study. those things would be hell yeah all the time, but i also need to eat, sleep and study things that will keep me alive and functional. so it can be a really hard decision actually, involves sacrificing time for what your really liked to be doing for a greater good (like me watching this video when i don't care about being organized and ""productive"" because this is time taken from what i love, but i discovered that doing this without a plan don't work).but it's important to know that you can change your priorities over time, therefore changing what becomes a hell yeah or no, allowing to do what you want.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.4208225607872009, 0.36773940920829773, 0.21143803000450134]"

"hey ali, can you make a video talking about how long it actually takes to building extra sources of income to the point of it actually producing regular income?so many vids on yt talk about starting side hustles, for example, but starting a thing on the side vs making regular extra money from it are two different things.i have a blog and a podcast, and i haven't made any money yet! blogging is much harder than ppl make it out to be - not just because of all the work of blogging, but having to be thrown into the world of seo that most ppl don't know about until they start a blog. that's how everything seems to be tho. you think it's just one thing - but it's the tip of the iceberg. even if it's dropshipping or starting a regular e-commerce store - the process is much harder than just creating an account. you have to know how to run ads/marketing, have money for those ads to run daily, research products to sell, order samples, etc, etc.please do a video all about the process and how long it takes to make money from each income stream.cheers","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5616657137870789, 0.2602728009223938, 0.17806148529052734]"

"i've been struggling with just finding time to take care of myself. if i wrote down everything i do in a day (which is a great place to start when figuring out just where your time goes and then planning your activities) i realize that i do so much for others. when you're a caretaker and must feed, bathe and support others all day, i don't end up even showering some days, let alone work out. i don't even see the sky for a week sometimes. i don't sleep normal hours and must respond to others in the middle of the night, throwing off my sleep schedule. how can i 'schedule' anything when i'm sleeping until noon because i couldn't get back to sleep after being woken at 3am? i get up and am starving and everyone else wants feeding so i quickly drink my sports shake so i have the stamina to make others their food, first. once that's done, i rush to go do whatever housework or business work i need to do, and a few hours (seems like minutes) it's time to feed everyone, again. it must be nice to be only responsible for yourself. i can't imagine what my life would be like if i didn't have anyone else to deal with - i suppose lonely? or, just busy doing my own stuff? i suppose i have to commit to making breakfasts at night so everyone can feed themselves when they get up. maybe then i could regain my day... lots to think about.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.7101718187332153, 0.16248632967472076, 0.12734179198741913]"

"if i may make a suggestion! do you think you could try being a bit more mindful with the way you offer tips? ""you are always in control of your time"" is actually quite a privileged reality. i definitely understand that you may have curated an audience for whom these tips are more applicable but with an audience of 1.5mil, i do imagine there are people looking for advice on how to manage their time within the constraints that they have - for many of us, we are not in control of every hour of our day because we would like to have food on the table! i know you can maybe argue that even those hours that are in your job, you are choosing to have that particular job (often not the case) or that we should apply these tips to the hours we do have control over but, i think that misses the point of having inclusivity be a standard not the exception :).","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.526256263256073, 0.25629574060440063, 0.21744807064533234]"

"hi ali,almost everywhere is recommended to use an external display with your laptop for better ergonomics better productivity etc.so i don't know if i am the crazy one... but i hate working on my external monitor because it fatigues my eyes so much. i have macbook pro m1 and lg ultrafine 4k display. when i am on my monitor my eyes start to hurt i feel like i have to focus more to read text on the screen. it's very good for a creative task like editing videos or working with photoshop. but when i am doing just casual office work (emails, browsing the internet...) then i prefer doing it on a smaller laptop screen because it's easier on my eyes. so because most of my work is casual office work then i would be better without spending money on the monitor. my wife is experiencing the same and prefers an m1 macbook air screen to a larger lg ultrafine. i think it could be because you are just staring into a larger glowing screen... it would seem intuitive. but none of the tech youtubers is talking about it.what's your honest experience with this phenomenon?","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5544939041137695, 0.28880712389945984, 0.15669895708560944]"

"man, as a filipino it honestly it makes me kind of sad when you mention the philippines cause of its cheap labor :( i know it's tempting to pay people just 7 usd an hour and feel like you're still doing them a favor, but i can assure you that those people would really appreciate a higher rate if the person hiring them could afford it and especially if they found the work really valuable to them. if you consider the amount of work freelancers have to put in and the structural limitations they experience, i feel it's only fair to try to compensate them fairly for that, not just in relative terms, but in absolute value (or close to it) as well. i know this kind of advice comes from books like the 4-hour work week, but honestly the ideas in that book have a very ruthless, outdated, almost neo-colonial vibe to them. yes, inequalities exist and there's only so much we can do to fix them (to be clear i don't expect ali to fix the problems of the world lol), and more often than not people will choose to take advantage of said inequality if it means making their lives easier. the reality is that that's become a norm, but honestly i wish that wasn't the case. i just worry that this piece of advice is such a recurring recommendation on your channel, especially in a time where people don't just need the bare minimum, but need empathy and any fair valuation of labor they can get. especially considering the fact that developing countries are truly truly struggling to get back on their feet because to the pandemic. i know you don't mean any ill, ali, and are just sharing what works for you. i just hope this kind of advice is delivered with a little more sensitivity or at least not given out without some kind of discussion of these realities. i am a longtime fan of your content and your channel, i just hope this constructive critique reaches you and perhaps serves as some food for thought. wishing you the best, man!","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.45721498131752014, 0.37673458456993103, 0.16605040431022644]"

"- ali stopped procrastinating after reading the war of art\r- know the enemy: resistance. fear creates resistance which creates more fear and it becomes an increasingly stronger cycle.\r- the solution is to interpret fear as a signal – fear is your compass. the more scared you are of something, the more important it is to you.\r- become a professional. a pro understands fear and failure is part of the process, they show up to work no matter what, resistance is the daily battle. conversely, an amateur's actions are mood-driven and goals are often extrinsic and hedonic (fun, money and status). \r- hence, also make sure your goals are process goals (i.e. upload 2 videos every week), which are things you can control vs. outcome goals (get 1 mil subscribers) which are nice and to be celebrated but not the point. the point is to trust the process and do the work.","['fears', 'frustrations', 'aspirations']","[0.883212149143219, 0.0635715201497078, 0.05321628972887993]"

"for what it is worth, i don’t think “input goals” vs. “output goals” is really correct. in the example you gave, they were all in fact output goals, including “i want to produce 2 videos per week for the rest of my life.” perhaps a simpler way to think of it, is to ask yourself are the goals i am constructing tied to actions that are reasonably within my control - or are they dependent upon the opinion of others? as folks i hang out with like to say, “you do the best you can and then leave the outcome to a power greater than yourself.” or words to that effect. in other words, we don’t focus on the outcome (as opposed to output). probably being anal retentive, in this case very publicly :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: but hey, i suspect i am not the only one attracted to your videos that might suffer from that plight! :thumbs_up:","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4173303544521332, 0.38403934240341187, 0.19863028824329376]"

"true opinion!!most of the things that he says here are going to make procrastination even worst. he kind of says some point right of course but again to sum up relies heavily on the notion of powering through that resistance.better way to approach procrastination!!if u feel resistance, focus on reducing the resistance and the load factor, not focus on increasing your effort.eg: if i don't feel like working today, its fine, i will just work for 1 hour today.. or 2 hours. u will most likely work longer than that but approach truly like its fine even if u worked just for 1 hour today.reduce your goal and the sense of how well the work has to be. once u reduce this self afflicted burden of setting urself a high goal, the work automatically becomes less intimidatingif the work itself is very twisted and difficult. focus on simplifying it first. focus on the simple stuff. do it first. and for the rest of the work, simplify and make it like manageable list of this and that and that.. the steps that u write be as simple as possible, that aim to detangle the complicated issue into more straighter, manageable steps. you are not a procrastinator the way u approach the work leads u to that feeling of resistance, lighten up ur aim, make it easy for yourself, focus on only task for next 1 hour, make things simpler, ask yourself how can i do this task the most most easiest way...and voila.. see the magic happen.and of course rely on a schedule rather than on motivation.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.39641451835632324, 0.3799436092376709, 0.22364191710948944]"

"summary for all you scroll-to-the-comments-procrastinators: - ali stopped procrastinating after reading the war of art- know the enemy: resistance. fear creates resistance which creates more fear and it becomes an increasingly stronger cycle.- the solution is to interpret fear as a signal – fear is your compass. the more scared you are of something, the more important it is to you.- become a professional. a pro understands fear and failure is part of the process, they show up to work no matter what, resistance is the daily battle. conversely, an amateur's actions are mood-driven and goals are often extrinsic and hedonic (fun, money and status). - hence, also make sure your goals are process goals (i.e. upload 2 videos every week), which are things you can control vs. outcome goals (get 1 mil subscribers) which are nice and to be celebrated but not the point. the point is to trust the process and do the work.","['fears', 'frustrations', 'aspirations']","[0.9230613112449646, 0.04813864827156067, 0.028799980878829956]"

":four_leaf_clover: i have a toxic relationship with productivity too. the past winterbreak moving to 2022, i was in the college dorms alone. i wanted to make sure i was happy and did fun things, and not stress about being productive. i counted the days of my break. there were 27 days, and each day i would post pictures about my day in one post on instagram. it’s like the most story worth moment of the day exercise. it could be as mundane as i ate a snowman cookie from starbucks or reading a book. or literally just a picture of my lunch. i wasn’t aiming for anything big. i just wanted to appreciate each day i had of the break. normally breaks go by too quickly, and i would feel i didn’t do enough. but by counting the days, i inadvertently focused on things that really mattered. at the start of the break my goal was to study blender and cad. by the end i was happy i tried making bread for the first time, and made an origami yoda. ^^ i feel like i started off 2022 very happy because of this, and also connected more with friends as i remembered more interactions each day.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.4224392771720886, 0.3776688873767853, 0.1998918205499649]"

"this was really refreshing and helpful ali. i've been trying to make videos and been super hard on myself whenever i missed an opportunity because i'm too tired or unmotivated. i think it is true that we need to push ourselves regardless of our emotional state sometimes, especially when we know that what we are doing is worth it and that we care about it. at the same time, it is a challenge to not get burned out when we are perfectionists. which is why i really find your point about being input-focused helpful in that regard, because it reduces the amount of energy, stress and anxiety surrounding things that we simply cannot control. all in all, thanks for this video where you let us be part of your (and our own) therapy :shamrock:","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5933765769004822, 0.32245275378227234, 0.08417069166898727]"

":four_leaf_clover: great video. losing the enjoyment in things that you normally enjoy is one of the hallmarks of depression, which sounds ominous but isn't necessarily. simple things like gloomy weather, inadequate sleep and letting nutrition and exercise fall by the wayside can all have this effect. my psychologist told me she started feeling depressed during covid due to ""behaviour activation"" not due to actually being depressed as such. basically the change of working from home and not having to get up early or leave the house were behaviours that are normally symptoms of depression. it sounds like your schedule of maybe not eating lunch properly and not sleeping as normal for e.g. could have partly lead to feeling the way you did.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5492690205574036, 0.2538512349128723, 0.19687969982624054]"

"hey ali, great video, love your honesty about this topic! so funny, because earlier this day i was thinking about my productivity system and how i see it:the first step is time management when you start to play with scheduling and then observing and analyzing how things work for you. then you start to notice that it's not all about your time, but about your mood, too. this brings you to step 2, where you start doing mood management. you are trying to find out what & how influences your mood waves. you are working on how to successfully riding your waves of energy and trying to reduce the time when you are in curve dropping, so the drops are smaller and smaller.but then it comes to step no. 3, which i call ""holistic productivity"". here it's not only about work that has to be done, but connecting all your main ""life areas"" in a way you feel satisfied. because even if you're productivity ninja during your work time, and then you are too tired to play with your kids, or without the energy for doing something you like, or you just don't feel satisfied with your day before you go to bed, in the long run, you'll become less productive. in this step, we understand we don't need to (or better we're not supposed to be) productive all the time, and be okay with that.i believe the main goal is to find the balance between ""working"" and ""being"".wish you all the best!:four_leaf_clover:","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4728620648384094, 0.2904398441314697, 0.23669807612895966]"

":four_leaf_clover: i hope i won't get lynched here (i'm sort of afraid i will), i really enjoy the effort you put to the content and have genuine belief that it helps people, but it also can harm. to the matter at hand - i wanted to write something here for a really long time, but now it fits the narrative. i think you would do your audience great favor if you would strongly mention from a time to time that productivity is just not for everyone. i had to learn this the hard way, as the only effect my countless effort had on me were amplifying my self criticism and actually achieving nothing. i had a history with depression, got over it, mustered my life together, applied to hard school, was having fun, but the work was a bit too overhelming i would say and i therefore sought help. sought it here. but somehow (and i'm, ofcourse, not blaming you, this is something fucked up inside my head) the only result i had after trying all the things offered was to just return back to the old inefficient life to actually muster up some results... only now i feel like i'm doing everything wrong and i can no longer appreciate what i loved to do (which was just being goofy around math/physics and having fun while doing it). it is not that my experience has worsened, neither did my ability to percieve the subjects - i actually rationally feel that i have gotten even better at it... but the reward system is broken. next week i'm gonna visit my psychiatrist again for advice how to help myself. from some kind of pressure i got to the point where i emotionally wonder whether i should even bother if it's not efficient and wonder how lucky i will be to finish the school in this mindset.if anyone answers i probably won't answer back since it hurts as fuck and this is about all what i can face right now.have a nice day people, please be kind to yourself and don't overdo tuff just because you have perfectiont's tendencies.it's not worth losing the fun.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5006630420684814, 0.37218090891838074, 0.12715604901313782]"

"choosing to be satisfied, i like that.could you have been scared ali? scared that you might be turning into someone or something you dont want to be or havent been in the past, scared that you are evloving beyond what you have been, beyond what you are known for here in the internet? are you listening to yourself these days? going back to the whys and whens and hows that i know from your videos, you used to. you are wonderful when you are listening to yourself ali and when you are in tune with your desires along with your duties. a change of environment and especially a change in engagement with people who you dont generally engage with, could help. perhaps connecting with a school and engaging with students about concerns and queries around productivity, maybe a non profit for children/education/etc relating to other things you are interested in, that you can help them with and also get paid for ofcourse. these are just some things that come up in my mind but you might not be interested, just, dont force yourself. i am glad you solved some problems, you do look lighter and fresher, maybe you showered idk lol. i hope you dont treat it at face value only though. i dont know you, i do know of you through some of your videos and it really is so visible ali. in the past few videos, in how grumpy or tired or resentful you seemed, although i never allowed that assumption to voice itself out, it was seen and there's no reason for us to allow that to be disregarded by oversimplification or overcomplication. we can meet it for what it is and treat it for what it is bc there is always a chance that your brain is being a little sneaky isnt it? hahaha. this was long, i havent had the time to comment on youtube since so long but anything for my favorite junior doctor who gets more money out of the internet than his job in medicine lmao.  i wish you all the good and uncomfortable things in the world. self assesment and reasoning all the way.","['fears', 'aspirations', 'frustrations']","[0.9005863070487976, 0.0513983890414238, 0.048015281558036804]"

"this is the new culture that is toxic, wanting to constantly be productive in all aspect everything becomes work even though it shouldn’t. you end up putting stuff on a to do list or routine like wake up at 6am workout do morning routine journal and get to work after you’ve finished your work in the evening there’s other stuff that needs to be ticked off even hobbies etc pick up a hobby do it after work etc everything now is a routine. i guess we have picked up this habit from the first lockdown but you honestly don’t need to fill your whole day in with these to do list and check everything off and when you’re not as productive (as humans you can be physically mentally drained and burnt out and need rest) you feel like you’ve achieved nothing that day. you need to see where productivity should lie in your day but soon as you have finished it you need to give yourself a chance to rest not every waking hour needs to be filled with some skill you need to learn.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5403645634651184, 0.2889191508293152, 0.1707163155078888]"

"hey, i was watching your videos really often before and they changed the way i approached learning. that was really helpful. somewhere along the way i stopped watching them because i too felt like i was concerned about productivity too much. i really like your chit-chat videos. i sometimes just like to hear what is going on in other peoples lifes, especially when i feel like i know them through their older videos.i am glad that you were able to change your approach and feel less stressed. i just wanted to say that your life is not just a list of achivements. it sounded a little like you were trying to be less stressed just to be able to be more productive as a result. i think you are a really cool person regardless of what you achive in your day or in life in general.also while your at it, i think your relationship with love and marriage might also be a little bit toxic. xd you might want a wife and that is fine. but don't try to change just so people find you more attractive. you are such a cool person. (that's why i watch your videos.) you don't have to gain muscles or be more flirty or less nerdy. just be yourself, you're already great. you don't need to take art lessons. of course you can do that if you want to. in the end we are all just idiots and we will always be idiots. and we will all die and nothing will matter anymore.so just be the idiot you want to be and be happy. maybe i am procrastinating in writing this comment.

"to be honest, lately i stopped watching your videos because as someone, who was brought up in a 'you're lazy the second you make a break' environment, it was just too much watching tipps on how to make even more out of your time. and it also felt weird seeing you only focus on productivity videos, so it started to seem really unhealthy. so thank you for recognizing it and also mentioning it, because i think in this day and age many people get caught up in the productivity cycle, where everybody thinks they need to wake up at 5am, wear same tshirt every day, because some successfull tech guys do that, and everybody needs to hustle until they either are millionairs or die trying. balance is key, and for myself, i noticed that the longer i don't take a break (because i seem not to have time for it), the worse my work gets. and the more i take breaks, the easier and more i get stuff done, because i feel more motivated and creative. making breaks, or taking more time for your tasks doesn't make you a 'wasteman","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.3913799524307251, 0.3133317232131958, 0.2952883839607239]"

"i know this feeling so very well. it comes from having promised yourself two very separate lives that can’t really coexist. when you were at your day job you thought about how much more productive you would be if only you could work full-time on youtube. you also likely daydreamed about how relaxing and free your day would be to have a lie in or be able to choose your own schedule. these are opposites. the truth is you will never be as productive with your time as when you worked a day job and had a solid focus on the small few hours you had control over. as much as you loved that level of productivity it required a level of energy that wasn’t sustainable and you dreamed of getting a break from. this now leaves you unhappy with your level of productivity as you are free to do less but still unsatisfied that you are not achieving more. you are also now getting backlash from the part of your mind that you promised would be allowed more of a rest. you will resent the things that you have to get up for as your body says “i was promised this life would be more restful and it’s not”. that is the start of burn out. when your mind says no to the work you genuinely want it to do and simple tasks feel heavy. the way around this is by recognising that one desire pulls you away from the other. stop expecting both the most productive day & the most fun day at the same time. you cannot achieve hard work & relaxation on the same day. balance can be found by having structured task focused hard-working early-start days that satisfy the productivity level you want. challenge yourself to hit an ambitious outcome that is exciting, with the promise of a full rest afterwards. then follow this up with several zero work, fun only, guilt free wasteman days. it creates a cycle of work & reward that is more in harmony and is more sustainable. it fulfils both needs without them competing. you owe yourself a backlog of those rest days first.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5863214731216431, 0.30981361865997314, 0.10386491566896439]"

"hey ali! 1st time commenting here. i think your past few videos clearly reflected the lack of passion and inspiration (your face betrays more than you possibly fathom) and i was one among many who either didnt bother clicking them or stopped watching them past the 2nd minute. having that said, keep 2 things in mind: 1) i'd rather watch 1 video per month from you rather than 8 videos where you clearly dont have fun. your content is not the thing that essentially makes your videos interesting (or at least only partly),  but it is your presentation and fun that infuse it with exuding interest and render it relatable or convincing or interesting in the first place. in other words, scarcity hurts your stats way less than you having no fun. 2) i have watched 90% of your videos thus far, ever since the beginning. from an ipad reviewer, you have grown to a productivity guru (and by far the most likeable of them too in my rather firm opinion), and so, even if unwillingly, you now possess  an influencer role. that means that your reflections about toxic productivity (stuff that is not limited to ""mere tips"" and theories), about the essence of productivity itself, the things that actually bother you in your everyday life, bother us, interest us and concerns us all far more than any just use-oriented videos. so please embrace your influencer status and talk freely and openly about whatever you actually wanna share.hope you take your time and read it.a longtime fan and supporter,angel","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.40387463569641113, 0.3709341883659363, 0.22519108653068542]"

people will find peace and meaningful relationships when they stop chasing yesterday nor tomorrow. being in the moment and listening to yourself and just relax will get you into the current moment and open up for opportunities you can not plan in advance like videos and job stuff. if you want magic in your life you need to give it room to grow. it is a timid phenomenon. slapping it down with plans over plans over plans created by our rational minds will not bring you magic. it will give you rational results but the human mind is more than that! it is emotions and magic. give yourself space to unfold yourself,"['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4605112671852112, 0.3378651440143585, 0.20162363350391388]"

"totally resonate with this, at uni i've found myself falling into the trap of ""if i'm not spending all my time on productive outlets then what's the point?"". one mental rethink i've found to be really beneficial is considering two forms of productivity: direct and indirect. direct productivity is the stuff that is obviously outwardly productive, while indirect productivity helps support the direct productivity by helping us approach the direct productivity with more energy and a better outlook. thus, taking breaks is indirectly productive. problem not entirely solved, but it's been a step in the right direction for me","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.39641860127449036, 0.30806562304496765, 0.2955158054828644]"

":four_leaf_clover::four_leaf_clover::four_leaf_clover:this was a video i needed to watch. lately i’ve been kicking myself for not being ‘as productive’ as i would like. i’m working to build routines and time-blocks to manage my time and resources more effectively, and the progress seems to be frustratingly slow going. i have this expectation that i’ll be some sort of productivity master by the end of the month. which i know isn’t any good- but that’s where my mind falls. i know for a fact that my discipline could still use some work. knowing when to tell myself (and others) ‘no’ and not feel like a bad person for doing it. in all honesty i’m just trying to cobble together something that will help me become a little less of a ‘waste-man’. my mind often swims with so many possibilities with how i can or should spend my time that i end up stalling out and doing nothing, procrastinating till a deadline and cramming to do the best i can. i occasionally have little tastes of what it feels like to be ‘productive’- and then i feel like i take a dip straight after. i’m trying to create a system that’s roughly level, while still being ‘higher performing’ than i’m at right now. because i know i can do better. it’s just that right now, i feel as though i’m probably focusing more on output goals than input goals- i always have been, honestly. at least up until recently. as an over-achiever i was always more set on the prize at the end rather than the process of how i get there- it’s a hard habit to break. but i’m doing it one step at a time. this video was the reminder i needed not to let myself dive too far down the opposite direction and to just, be kinder to myself. that was needed, for sure. so thank you, ali. it was truly appreciated.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.7464922666549683, 0.15837223827838898, 0.09513542056083679]"

i think there's a lot o0f content available on your channel which is really good but there is no order to it in case of actually following it.a person who is in really bad mental state will just stop the vedio cause it is too much information eve to apply practically which sets them off.solution is to make a playlist for beginners with very minimal and basic changes in their life which could produce results in their life( very simple and easy tricks). and you can make more playlists on how to get further down in lane of productivity. i think it will really bring more watchers and subscribers to your channel. you should revise your content and should find levels from 1-10..in which a person can actually know that i have to do this much only and just start by small.,"['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.5447816252708435, 0.2418239563703537, 0.213394433259964]"

"when you free up your brain from remembering, enhancing thereby the work memory, you would think you have less stress and be able to focus on creating ideas. that's exactly what will happen, in fact, it will be so good that you start to produce tons of ideas. but then, eventually, there will be more ideas to act upon than there is time, meanwhile new ideas keep stacking up. then eventually one ends up with the same amount of stress multiplied by at least ten times, because of brain explosion instead of brain implosion. so next stop, for me at least, is to optimize the organizational structure, but while doing that, even more new clever ideas still keep stacking up. \r\rconclusion: in the end, the true way to survive is to have great ability to put things really into perspective and do lots of self-reflection. even while i'm now trying to reduce the amount of information i myself produce, i still keep producing new information trying to figure out and understand how to actually do that.\r\rgreat video's, i'm prioritizing your channel for my productivity blueprint.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.4910498261451721, 0.30880698561668396, 0.20014314353466034]"

"i'm an old man now, but i""ve keep notes from everything i""ve read since just after high school. in college i took a look at my high school notes and realized i had trouble reading my own handwriting. so i retyped all my notes. at the end of each college semester i started going through my notes for each class, boiling them down what seemed useful (or forgetable) and typed those as well. it wasn't until later in college that i realized i could not use many of my notes in papers because i did not collect where it came from for a citation, and fixed that for the future. i still have my original little notebook, which became 3 little 3-ring binders. i switched to composition notebooks where i captured notes, and later maybe 3-4 times per notebook i would type of the notes i wanted added to my digital collection. when i learned how to use google drive and docs, i decided to share my notes with my peers and still to this day offer that link freely. funny though, few have offered to share their collected knowledge. i suspect i will continue doing this until the very end. i look forward to tiago's book, and enjoy your videos. if i don't seem to find a nugget in each one, it's pretty close to a 1:1 ratio. great presentations. the topics have substance. the tempo is good, also i too often speed up what i listen to unless i""m focussed on taking notes. thank you, and keep it up.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5575977563858032, 0.24295097589492798, 0.19945131242275238]"

"first time watching your video so fast xdvideo ideas: how do you create so much? like your system for actually getting tasks done, thinking through what you have saved and thus creating - i have seen your productivity system video but that was more like separate apps and i am curious how it comes together. previously you have mentioned gtd (as a book you read etc) and apps you use, but i'm curious because i feel like you do so much (it's almost like hermione granger and her time turner). would also be interested in how your extensive team would contribute to the system you have. i watched your previous video on like your days ""filming with aid of your team, having writers and like how you work with your team"" and that was really interesting so i am curious about specifics?  productivity system - do you use a todo list now? weekly reviews (gtd)? a central task list managed by your team?daily productivity stuff - so i check my calendar then like time-blocked tasks i set in my weekly review but realistically i don't always manage to do all the things that i want to get done? working with a team - you are doing something really new in a way? your company is essentially built based on your youtube video channel and courses - thus it would be fascinating to see how a team helps you with youtube + how to breakdown the video making process into units that other people can help with? (so say you have write-research-film-edit and you have people doing writing, researching, contacting other content creators, processing email offers and brand offers, organizing the filming and equipment setup, editting and content quality check - how does this all get managed?)other stuff you are doing - a large appeal of your channel to me is seeing the different aspects of a content creator's lifestyle and i would be interested in content that goes deeper around that. like how do you decide on how to deal with brand deals, early access offers, somewhat similar to the ethics of sponsorships post that tom buck had. on your deep dive podcast, i see you interview other content creators a lot and it would be nice to have a more in-depth look at how you make these decisions too.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.433138906955719, 0.33638375997543335, 0.23047733306884766]"

yeah often things are made less or overcomplicated. theres logic behind the way the world works and how you should approach it. in order for something to happen it needs an impulse (cause and effect). but we need to keep in mind why we want things to be done. its often because we want the freedom afterwards. some peaple just forget what they even work for.,"['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.6277632117271423, 0.27533969283103943, 0.09689711034297943]"

":bullseye: key takeaways for quick navigation:00:00 this video discusses actionable tips from the book ""someday is today"" by matthew dicks, offering practical advice for achieving more in life.01:09 tip 1: embrace the ""parking lot practice"" - true productivity doesn't have to look pretty; don't wait for the perfect environment to pursue creative work.03:58 tip 2: adopt the ""minutes mindset"" - value every minute, leapfrogging between tasks rather than focusing solely on hours, maximizing productivity in short timeframes.06:50 tip 3: use the ""lily pad method"" - break down overwhelming goals into smaller tasks, jumping between them based on your mood and energy, fostering flexibility and progress.09:42 tip 4: embrace the ""horizon habit"" - set directional goals on the horizon instead of overly specific goals, promoting flexibility and resilience in achieving long-term aspirations.11:22 tip 5: beware the ""piano precedent"" - five-year plans can invite unexpected challenges; find a balance between planning and adapting to life's twists and turns.12:31 tip 6: consider the ""100-year-old plan"" - when at a crossroads, imagine advice from your 100-year-old self to prioritize what truly matters, providing a broader perspective on decision-making.13:56 tip 7: embrace the ""purposeful approach"" - productivity isn't just about work; define ""soft goals"" that bring meaning and satisfaction to your life, allowing time for what truly matters.made with harpa ai","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.6368566751480103, 0.20123609900474548, 0.16190719604492188]"

"my takeaway :star:!!!!1.  productivity is not pretty: overcome ideal environment dependency, e.g., the parking lot story.2.  embrace the minutes mindset: get the most out of every minute, like when you are waiting at a restaurant.3. the lily pad method: tackle your projects in a non-linear fashion by working on any part you feel like at the moment to maintain momentum and reduce overwhelm.4. plan with horizon goals: goals are just destinations; they shouldn't be a source of stress. this also leads to the idea that horizon goals, such as becoming a writer and doing other billion things related to writing, give you both freedom and resilience.5. five-year plans are inviting the universe to drop a piano on you: when you plan everything, it's bound to have something go wrong. you have your plans on one axis and fate on the other, and the path your life takes is sort of somewhere between these two lines. so, think of plans as these dots on a chart that you will sometimes touch upon.6. the solomon project: spend time journaling with your older self to reflect on what matters to you, to reveal what you want your legacy to be, and your long-term plans.7. the purposeful approach: be productive for the sake of maximizing fun, work, and relationships. don't just think of it in terms of economic output.thank you ali for your enlightening content. following you since 2020:blue_heart:","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4622516930103302, 0.3694324791431427, 0.1683158576488495]"

"the video is about how to be effortlessly disciplined.\r\rthe speaker, ali abdaal, who is a doctor turned entrepreneur and the author of feelgood productivity, argues that focusing too much on discipline might not be the best approach. instead, he proposes five science-backed methods to develop effortless discipline:\r\rmental contrasting: this involves visualizing your desired future state and contrasting it with your current reality. this discrepancy between where you are and where you want to be is supposed to motivate you to take action. for example, imagine yourself achieving your fitness goals and then contrast that with how you feel now.\rimplementation intentions: this method involves setting up if-then statements to deal with obstacles that might come in your way. for instance, if your goal is to write more, you can set up an if-then statement like ""if i get distracted while writing, i will get up and do a quick walk around the room and then come back and start writing again.""\rreduce environmental friction: this means designing your environment to make it easier to be disciplined. for example, if you want to go to the gym more often, lay out your gym clothes the night before so you can easily put them on in the morning.\rmonitoring and tracking: tracking your progress can be a great motivator. seeing yourself improve over time will give you a sense of accomplishment and make you want to keep going. there are many apps available to help you track your habits.\rmake it enjoyable: when you enjoy what you’re doing, you’re less likely to need discipline. try to find ways to make boring tasks more fun. for instance, you could listen to upbeat music while you study or find a pretty coffee shop to work in.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.7272075414657593, 0.17854870855808258, 0.09424370527267456]"

"google bard summary about this video: :eyes:the video is about how to be more disciplined. the speaker, ali abdaal, who is a doctor turned entrepreneur, introduces five science-backed methods to achieve this goal.the first method is mental contrasting, which involves contrasting your present reality with your desired future to create a sense of urgency and motivation. the second method is implementation intentions, which involves creating if-then statements to plan how you will overcome obstacles that might hinder you from achieving your goals.the third method is reducing environmental friction, which involves designing your environment to make it easier to do the things you want to do and avoid the things you don't want to do. the fourth method is monitoring and tracking, which involves tracking your progress to stay motivated and make adjustments as needed.the fifth method is finding ways to make what you're doing more enjoyable or energizing. this can involve incorporating play, power, and people into your activities to make them more fun and engaging.overall, the video emphasizes that discipline is not about willpower, but about creating systems and habits that make it easier to do the things you want to do. by following these five methods, you can become more effortlessly disciplined and achieve your goals.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5150219798088074, 0.26910775899887085, 0.21587030589580536]"

"the word discipline has the word ""disc"" in it. the planets in the sky are ""discs"". the are made of plasma, when anyone looks at them with a high zoom camera such as the canon p900, they all see the planets as fluid moving water like things. the planets are not what nasa says they are. nasa are a bunch of liars. discs in the sky work as wifi signals. if one does not know their own astrolgy, one does not know their natal chart. in ones natal chart we can see, for instance, where one's mars is placed and which house it's in. depending on the sign and house placement will determine how one takes action. saturn is about discipline.  depending on what sign saturn is in and what house it's in will tell one all about ones discipline style.this guy just wants to help himself by giving general advice which is limited in scope and in reality will not help one as astrolgy would.when using a natal chart make sure to pick whole signs as the house system.find our where ur saturn is and it will describe how you approach discipline in a personal, not general manner.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.41629937291145325, 0.2963583171367645, 0.28734225034713745]"

"if you're short on time, here's a quick summary of the valuable information ali shared in this video!1. mental contrasting. recognizing the difference between our current state and our desired state makes it easier for us to act in ways conducive to reaching our goal.2. implementation intentions or habit-stacking. obstacles are bound to arise; developing a tangible plan for overcoming foreseeable challenges is a great way to keep moving.3. environment design. whether you are having trouble dieting or getting work done, create an environment that moves the marker in your direction. a typical example would be keeping candy out of your house if you're trying to eat healthier.4. time management and tracking. tracking our behavior is eye-opening to how we are truly spending our time. it's scientifically proven that by creating a quantitative awareness of our goals, we can increase motivation, create feedback loops, and improve clarity. [bonus: use an app called streaks!]5. make your work enjoyable. getting yourself to do something you know drains your energy is much more work. you can remove friction by adding enjoyable elements to your work; find some way to romanticize your life.hope this was helpful!","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5288822650909424, 0.4253615140914917, 0.04575623571872711]"

"i really enjoyed this video - and it prompted me to purchase the audio version of your book.  i've watched quite a few of your videos, particularly on productivity. what i think would be a great addition to your content would be to include ""templates"" in the video description to make artefacts you discussed in each video so people can start with something rather than a blank paper.  for example:- a sample ideal calendar that people could copy to their own (not sure if this is possible)- template for writing digitally down the wheel of life (click to create based on template)- template for how to write goals (click to create based on template)these might seem like simple things to make, but i think they can make all the difference in getting people to adopt the ideas and put them into practice - particularly if you embed some of the graphics or visual aids you use in the videos and can make it really visually appealing to use. over time these could become part of a digital toolkit that could be used for people and might be a new way to reposition your content into an interactive book that gives people the mental models, but also creates the content and tools to keep them active and current in your life. in the same way that you have previously described about reducing the friction to use these (i think i remember a wireless earphone example in an old video :p).if you get the time i would really like to know if you had tried this before, or whether or not this is something you'd consider :) happy 2024!","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.46390002965927124, 0.33237335085868835, 0.20372667908668518]"

"ali thanks for this video along with all the other learnings this year and even before, for the goal you have about physical health i would suggest do 100 burpess everyday. it would really help. its a full body workout. you can start 100 burpess for 30 days and see if you want to take it ahead. starting with 100 burpees a day for 30 days can significantly boost your cardiovascular endurance, strength, and overall fitness. it's a tough challenge but a rewarding one. remember to listen to your body and gradually progress to avoid strain. good luck with your fitness goals, and here's to a healthier and stronger you!","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.6437664031982422, 0.1977098137140274, 0.1585237979888916]"

"this is great content but also it is confronting as i struggle with this since severe burnout and depression in 2019. i was always about feeling and intuition. my worst symptom of burnout and depression was emotional numbness and thus lack of feelings towards anything. to this day they have not fully returned as i they used to be. i want to do things differently and things that matter to me instead of people pleasing and hunting for status. my life used to be guitar and music for example. i had the ambition to play, teach, write, make content and since 2019 i lost that feeling of exitement. i also like reef aquarium keeping which is also a candidate for content creation. the process  of storytelling and filmmaking sounds great too. but how do i choose the best path if i don't feel a burning fire for one more than the other if that makes sense? not knowing what to choose and the posibillity of regretting my choise later is making me feel stuck! with a fulltime job and a family with 2 kids i just can't have them all. i was already looking into making a content channel about reefing and music but that is so much apart. creating and studying/maintaining both hobbies would not fit my planning. i also subbed to skillshare wanting to study content creation and storytelling but there is only 24h in a day.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5295895934104919, 0.38891705870628357, 0.08149338513612747]"

"""know yourself"" is an important one. maybe the most important one. and to truly know yourself you need to be able to leave the beaten path and out of your own bottle, as you say it. you have to ""lose yourself"". i feel that this productivity-, lists-, plans- etc. thing has a lot to do with feeling in control and feeling that you're going somewhere, but it's actually keeping you trapped in the bottle because it's too timid and too rational. i also feel that religious rules do that - they have the purpose to maintain order, but in order to lose yourself you must enter chaos. so what i would say you should do if you feel lost: embrace it and lose yourself even more - it's an opportunity to learn something about yourself, but for that you must be ""truly"" lost first.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5222362875938416, 0.3276802599430084, 0.1500834971666336]"

"hey ali, i have some feedback regarding the new audio-track feature. as a german native speaker i discovered your use of the ai translating tool you use to have new audio tracks for different languages. it is really cool to see how you want to spread your audience further! however, the ai seems to forget some (filler-)words and therefore mess up the meaning of some sentences. also the intonation is quite poorly at times., especially in the beginning which made me switch back to english immediately to hear what it was supposed to sound like.i don't know if you have someone reviewing those tracks so i just wanted to give you some feedback :dreally enjoyed your video, take care!","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.7452170848846436, 0.15753032267093658, 0.09725263714790344]"

"business idea for you: create pdfs or other shareable visuals that people can access via subscription. the visual iconography that your team has designed is really awesome. i am a very visual person and the videos that are the most useful to me have visual elements like this. i take screenshots of the visuals and put them in notion or elsewhere to help me remember the concepts. i will be going back through this video and doing that with the main points. it's so useful. the ""treat yourself like a robot"" concept is extremely useful and even now--after only seeing the icon once--it's in my head visually in a very clear way. if there were a subscription i could pay for that would allow me to access the ""lessons"" as visual displays featuring your absolutely awesome icons that would be so worth it. also whoever is creating those icons for you is definitely one of your most valuable resources (in addition to time, of course ;-).","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.5957521200180054, 0.20476064085960388, 0.19948731362819672]"

"i feel like the ‘beating myself up’ experience is often a function of the emotion of disappointment.  i care about the things i want to do and when they don’t work out i am swamped by painful disappointment.  i could respond to this by taking it out on myself or others, or i could just accept it and experience the disappointment i feel and try to move on. i might prevent disappointment by not having too many expectations or acknowledging i’m not able to control outcomes but these things cause a lot of anxiety. feeling out of control, whether it is true or not (it is) leads to a lot more emotion.so how do you manage these emotions ali? do you compartmentalize? do you do cbt? are you congenitally a very chill? do you have a medication practice? i feel often that the stakes in my life are so high, that every decision is an emotional tightrope walk, even though i generally don’t believe in negative self talk.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.4971797466278076, 0.43502357602119446, 0.06779668480157852]"

"i am so delighted that i found this video because right now i'm faced with my inability to plan my time effectively and manage my days. since the last year of school i'm in a boarding school which is more demanding and requires more effort. but my time management hasn't even existed because school was easy these days and my mom was kinda ""my manager"". therefore i had to figure out by myself since then how to organize my life (my calendar, when do i study, i got confronted with the need to plan studying, my problem of balancing my sleep shedule, my social life and friends, studying so i still get my wanted marks, appointments and so on). it may sound a bit weird or that i'm just a silly highschool student in germany, i mean what could i do wrong? i get up, go to school in less than 5 minutes, eat, study, sleep, repeat?. but i struggle deeply with procrastination, and lack of sleep (an average of maybe 5 hours of sleep, sometimes less), i'm often exhausted and just wanna rest. ""my rest"" so far in my holiday is most of the time social media (youtube and instagram) and yes, i'm watching this video in my holiday but wanted to study. last year of school was just really horrible for me and especially my mental health and physical health had suffered from it. i experienced and experience deeply the consequences of a wrong or missing time management and also in general low discipline. i hope in the future i can figure it out, hence be happier and healthier. for real, i don't know why i wrote all this down here. normally i'm not writing that long comments because who wants to read these long comments, but maybe your video series will help me out with time management. i definitely loved the first part and i'm looking forward to the others. thank you, ali!","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5285961627960205, 0.3112446963787079, 0.160159170627594]"

cleaning is one of the things that keep people living longer and healthier. and has a positive impact on delaying and preventing issues like dementia. maybe worth going out of the comfortzone for sooner than later. auriikatarina is a great channel inspiring many w the joy for cleaning. it's not smth we see in movies and novels as necessary and wholesome and cosy. murakami is the only writer that actively included cleaning and cooking which is why i recommend him to anyone suffering from depression or just general neurodivergency in some way. the only movie where i saw it portrayed in such a way is the equalizer w denzel washington. it's not been adequately marketed sadly. and that impacts many lives mine included negatively.,"['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.462456077337265, 0.38419830799102783, 0.15334564447402954]"

"ali - personally i think the ""i'm a doctor turned entrepreneur"" intro is a tad misleading and false.  perhaps i misunderstand your situation - but - have you ever practiced medicine?  being an md entails a completely different level of selflessness that entrepreneurs simply do not - or perhaps cannot - possess.  i consulted with a friend on this one and she assures me that ""being a doctor"" is only a credible claim after many years of practice and not just graduation from medical school and completion of a residency program.  i am in no way trying to negate your accomplishments in medical school - however - imho ""being"" a doctor is very different than being even the most successful of entrepreneurs.  perhaps a much more appropriate intro would be ""i was a doctor who is now an entrepreneur""?  i would gladly accept your reshaping of my head on this one.","['frustrations', 'fears', 'aspirations']","[0.47096168994903564, 0.28714948892593384, 0.24188880622386932]"

"love all your tips!  i will implement the ones relating to limiting screen time. your explanation helps me to understand my dopamine issue better.  where chores are concerned, my time cost per hour isn't high enough to justify hiring a cleaner and  i often find that cleaners don't always deliver on total cleanliness lol.  what i do find important when it comes to only spending as little time as necessary on chores is to simplify them and my surroundings so that things get done swiftly with minimal effort.  minimalism is key for fast cleaning because getting around the clutter takes time and effort.  having little systems/hacks to streamline chores really help too.  (example: place large piece of paper underneath chopping board and push peelings etc on to the paper.  then wrap up and discard) lastly, just keeping clean and tidy as one goes.","['aspirations', 'frustrations', 'fears']","[0.4347740411758423, 0.35577064752578735, 0.20945534110069275]"

"s made to be addictive and i realised if i let myself watch it for a few minutes, in a week it will turn into a few hours. so i never watch it, and so should you. - this is your life now. its not a detox, its not temporary, so build a system which is sustainable for yourself. for example, i always allow myself watch channels that i am subscribed to, but none of them are addicitive entertainment, they all are educational. find nieches on yt that only inspire you and give you energy and cut the rest. no recommended feed, ever. - limiting time does not work, at all. limit the content instead. its like saying, i will be a crack addict only for 15 minutes a day. if you allow yourself even a little bit, you will have urges all day and dealing with them is stressful. however, if you quit the addictive behavior completely, you will stop feeling this tension overtime. - if your life is empty, it is naturall to fill the void with unintentional  entertainment. you may feel this void very strongly, and it can be painfull in the beginning, and that is great. now, to succesfully replace addictive garbage with real life, slowly start adding real activities: fitness, hobbies, friendship, romance, etc. if you do not, it is going to feel empty and you will be constantly tempted to fall back into addiction.\xa0we all just want to live. all entertainment is an illusory replacement of doing things. you are normal, you have good intentions, but most of us have fallen to this trap, coming from sillicon valley, that made us to believe it is ok to reduce human experience to scrolling. now our responsibility is to get out.i believe in you, best of luck, you really can do this.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.42745429277420044, 0.40797847509384155, 0.1645672619342804]"

"with all the respect to you and your and success: i truly believe the ""delegate chores"" story is flawed. i don't know how much of the world you know, but as someone who comes from south america, where ""delegating chores"" is normalized in several places, i can say it messes up with our senses of responsibilities. it's easy to fall into the trap of ""delegating everything you don't like"", and it's easy to cross the line of becoming a non-functional adult. it's important (my opinion) to do things you dislike sometimes. that's another way to talk about ""get out of your comfort zone"". i won't even go into how this can contribute to social inequality, standardization of ""gender roles"", etc.besides my rant above, cheers, bro, wishing you all the success.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.5973528027534485, 0.2102118581533432, 0.1924353837966919]"

"a thing i learned early on thanks to my search for a system for myself to help cope with my inability to properly filter out stimuli around me, i learned it is easier for me to focus on something that i feel more pull towards. for example, i needed to work on my history course final paper, but i felt a larger pull to working on a creative endeavor at the time. by working on the latter first, i found it easier to shift to doing the paper after when i lost the pull or “motivation” to work on the original project. in the past when i did the opposite, i struggled to even work on the paper as well as it took twice as long to work on the assignment as it should have realistically.","['frustrations', 'aspirations', 'fears']","[0.46244725584983826, 0.4192509651184082, 0.11830171197652817]"
